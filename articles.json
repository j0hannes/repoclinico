Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings.

As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11\u2009791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\u000bMethods\u000bA scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors\u2019 affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.\u000bResults\u000bMost of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus\u2019 origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.\u000bConclusions\u000bThere has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.", "language": "en", "handle": "Adhikari2020-Epidemiology_causes_clinical_manifestation_and_diagnosis_prevention_and_control_of_coronavirus_disease_COVI"}, {"title": "Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations of COVID-19", "authors": "Agarwal, Amol|Chen, Alan|Ravindran, Nishal|To, Chau|Thuluvath, Paul J.", "date": "2020-04-01", "doi": "10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097368832030027X?v=s5", "medium": "Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S097368832030027X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Gastroenterolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV,-2 has continued to progress, and increasing information is becoming available about the incidence of digestive symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected. These are postulated to be related to the virus\u2019s use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus.

Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21\u201340 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use.

For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy.

This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students\u2019 perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak.\nMethods\nWe randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed.\nResults\nOne hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 \u00b1 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 \u00b1 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1\u201310 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV.\nConclusions\nMedical students\u2019 psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately.

patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nResults\nModerate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration.

It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission.\nMethod\nWe included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u00a0=\u00a01.06; 95% CI [1.02\u20131.098], P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.004), male gender (AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.617; 95% CI [1.365\u20131.77], P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and diabetes (AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.68; 95% CI [1.346\u20131.848], P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.

This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians.\nWe discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population.

Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS.\nMethods\nThis retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance.\nResults\nOf 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P\n=0.02).

The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical. This article reviews the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the basic principles of molecular techniques commonly used for their detection and characterization.

A cluster of patients with atypical pneumonia identified in Wuhan, China, served as the epicenter of this recent epidemic. This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012. The Southern China Wholesale Market reportedly has connections to the original 27 cases in Wuhan, China. The worldwide confirmed case total has eclipsed 1,450,000, with more than 83,000 deaths. Patient presentation ranges from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent death. Early epidemiologic studies of viral spread support the hypothesis that COVID-19 can remain latent with an extended and infectious incubation period. The U.S. government has issued level 3 precautions for most international travel, along with prohibiting entry to foreign nationals traveling from China, Iran, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the European Schengen area (e.g., France, Italy, Germany). Prevention remains the mainstay in treating and defeating the COVID-19 epidemic. Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should self-quarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation.

Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8\u201312% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients.\nConclusions\nMost of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.", "language": "en", "handle": "Barazzoni2020-ESPEN_expert_statements_and_practical_guidance_for_nutritional_management_of_individuals_with_SARS-CoV-2_i"}, {"title": "Case report of chloroquine therapy and hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes: What should we have in mind during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "authors": "Baretic\u0301, Maja", "date": "2020-08-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.014", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300795", "medium": "Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Type 1 diabetes|Chloroquine|Hypoglycaemia|Remission", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1871402120300795_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Cloroquina & Hidroxicloroquina"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nA type 1 diabetes patient experienced remission associated with chloroquine therapy while travelling to a malaria-endemic area.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd\nof 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd\n< 1,000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course.

However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention.

In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency.

In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions.

Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice.

More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%\u20132%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600\u00a0mg twice daily; Days 2\u201314: 600\u00a0mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1\u201314: 400\u00a0mg/100\u00a0mg twice daily) plus IFN-\u03b1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5\u20139) d versus 11 (8\u201313) d, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm.

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection.

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36\u201366 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3\u20136 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6\u201310 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.", "language": "en", "handle": "Chen2020-Clinical_Study_of_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cell_Treatment_for_Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome_Induced_by_Epidemic_I"}, {"title": "Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records", "authors": "Chen, Huijun|Guo, Juanjuan|Wang, Chen|Luo, Fan|Yu, Xuechen|Zhang, Wei|Li, Jiafu|Zhao, Dongchi|Xu, Dan|Gong, Qing|Liao, Jing|Yang, Huixia|Hou, Wei|Zhang, Yuanzhen", "date": "2020-03-13", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620303603", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079288295", "filename": "S0140673620303603_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Obstetricia"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.

Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1\u00b70\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\u20139 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9\u201310. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.", "language": "en", "handle": "Chen2020-Clinical_characteristics_and_intrauterine_vertical_transmission_potential_of_COVID-19_infection_in_nine_pregnan"}, {"title": "Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China", "authors": "Chen, Jun|Qi, Tangkai|Liu, Li|Ling, Yun|Qian, Zhiping|Li, Tao|Li, Feng|Xu, Qingnian|Zhang, Yuyi|Xu, Shuibao|Song, Zhigang|Zeng, Yigang|Shen, Yinzhong|Shi, Yuxin|Zhu, Tongyu|Lu, Hongzhou", "date": "2020-05-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301195", "medium": "Journal of Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|Clinical progression|Viral clearance|Clinical characteristics", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32171869", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082689373", "filename": "S0163445320301195_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nStudies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.\nResults\nOf the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2\u20137) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12\u201320) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8\u201311 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P\u00a0<0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10\u201312 days).

We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets.

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+\u223c3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+\u223c3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.

We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.\nResults\nAmong the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA. Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P=.02). The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10cpm in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10cpm in patients without diarrhea (P=.06).

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France.\nMethods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France.\nResults: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.\nDiscussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.", "language": "en", "handle": "Chevance2020-Assurer_les_soins_aux_patients_souffrant_de_troubles_psychiques_en_France_pendant_l_\u00e9pid\u00e9mie_\u00e0_SARS-CoV-2"}, {"title": "Cuidado respiratorio en COVID-19", "authors": "Chica-Meza, Carmen|Pen\u0303a-Lo\u0301pez, Luis Alexander|Villamari\u0301n-Guerrero, He\u0301ctor Fabio|Moreno-Collazos, Jorge Enrique|Rodri\u0301guez-Corredor, Lizeth Catherine|Lozano, Wilson Mauricio|Vargas-Ordon\u0303ez, Mo\u0301nica Patricia", "date": "2020-04-06", "doi": "10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0122726220300318", "medium": "Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Nuevo coronavirus 2019|2019-nCoV|Enfermedad respiratoria|Ventilacio\u0301n meca\u0301nica|Oxigenoterapia|2019 novel coronavirus|2019-nCoV|Respiratory disease|Mechanical ventilation|Oxygen therapy", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0122726220300318_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neumologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Resumen\nAntecedentes\nEl COVID-19 forma parte de la familia de los virus conocida como Coronaviridae.

The new pathogen \u03b2-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading to severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nObjective\nTo review the available scientific evidence related to the care of the respiratory system in order to establish general treatment guidelines.\nMethods\nNarrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search, selection, and review of original and secondary articles written in English or Spanish in the different databases: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to March 2020.\nResults\nNo specific treatment for the new disease has been defined, with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure. The use of biosecurity elements, such as goggles, hats, gloves, long waterproof aprons, high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel (FFP2 or N95) is recommended. In symptomatic patients use surgical masks, hospital soap, paper towels, and 70% alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Use oxygen through low flow systems.

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.", "language": "en", "handle": "Chow2020-Cardiovascular_Collapse_in_COVID-19_Infection-The_Role_of_Veno-Arterial_Extracorporeal_Membrane_Oxygenation_VA-"}, {"title": "Remdesivir, lopinavir, emetine, and homoharringtonine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro", "authors": "Choy, Ka-Tim|Wong, Alvina Yin-Lam|Kaewpreedee, Prathanporn|Sia, Sin Fun|Chen, Dongdong|Hui, Kenrie Pui Yan|Chu, Daniel Ka Wing|Chan, Michael Chi Wai|Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang|Huang, Xuhui|Peiris, Malik|Yen, Hui-Ling", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635422030200X", "medium": "Antiviral Research", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Remdesivir|Lopinavir|Ritonavir|Emetine|Homoharringtonine|ABSTRACT", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S016635422030200X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Antivirales"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "An escalating pandemic by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed.

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures.\nPregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2.\nHere we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.", "language": "en", "handle": "Dashraath2020-Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Pandemic_and_Pregnancy"}, {"title": "A strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak", "authors": "Daszak, Peter|Olival, Kevin J.|Li, Hongying", "date": "2020-03-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053620300161", "medium": "Biosafety and Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Disease emergence|Surveillance|Risk reduction|Market biosecurity|2019-nCoV", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2590053620300161_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nA novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world.

As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.", "language": "en", "handle": "Daszak2020-A_strategy_to_prevent_future_epidemics_similar_to_the_2019-nCoV_outbreak"}, {"title": "Urgent dental care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": "Dave, Manas|Seoudi, Noha|Coulthard, Paul", "date": "2020-04-03", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30806-0", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620308060", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0140673620308060_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Dave2020-Urgent_dental_care_for_patients_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}, {"title": "Corona virus infection in Syria, Libya and Yemen; an alarming devastating threat", "authors": "Daw, Mohamed A.", "date": "2020-04-02", "doi": "10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101652", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301204", "medium": "Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1477893920301204_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Daw2020-Corona_virus_infection_in_Syria_Libya_and_Yemen_an_alarming_devastating_threat"}, {"title": "Head and neck oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Reconsidering traditional treatment paradigms in light of new surgical and other multilevel risks", "authors": "Day, Andrew T.|Sher, David J.|Lee, Rebecca C.|Truelson, John M.|Myers, Larry L.|Sumer, Baran D.|Stankova, Lenka|Tillman, Brittny N.|Hughes, Randall S.|Khan, Saad A.|Gordin, Eli A.", "date": "2020-04-06", "doi": "10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104684", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520301202?v=s5", "medium": "Oral Oncology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "head and neck cancer|head and neck oncology|mucosal squamous cell carcinoma|surgical barriers|surgical risk|multilevel risk|treatment paradigms|COVID-19 pandemic|SARS-CoV-2|risk stratification", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1368837520301202_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms. Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed.\nNovel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: 1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; 2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; 3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; 4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; 5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing.\nTraditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient. Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.", "language": "en", "handle": "Day2020-Head_and_neck_oncology_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic-Reconsidering_traditional_treatment_paradigms_in_light_of_ne"}, {"title": "The impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on head and neck cancer patients\u2019 care", "authors": "De Felice, Francesca|Polimeni, Antonella|Valentini, Vincenzo", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.radonc.2020.03.020", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167814020301511", "medium": "Radiotherapy and Oncology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Coronavirus|Head neck cancer|Radiotherapy|Surgery|Chemotherapy|Care|Treatment", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0167814020301511_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Oncolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "DeFelice2020-The_impact_of_Coronavirus_COVID-19_on_head_and_neck_cancer_patients_care"}, {"title": "Managing neonates with respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2", "authors": "De Luca, Daniele", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30073-0", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464220300730", "medium": "The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32151320", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081663607", "filename": "S2352464220300730_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Pediatr\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "DeLuca2020-Managing_neonates_with_respiratory_failure_due_to_SARS-CoV-2"}, {"title": "COVID-19 from veterinary medicine and one health perspectives: What animal coronaviruses have taught us", "authors": "Decaro, Nicola|Martella, Vito|Saif, Linda J.|Buonavoglia, Canio", "date": "2020-08-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.04.009", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528820304720", "medium": "Research in Veterinary Science", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|Veterinary medicine|Animal coronaviruses|One health", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0034528820304720_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Decaro2020-COVID-19_from_veterinary_medicine_and_one_health_perspectives-What_animal_coronaviruses_have_taught_us"}, {"title": "Novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A lesson from animal coronaviruses", "authors": "Decaro, Nicola|Lorusso, Alessio", "date": "2020-05-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108693", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520302935", "medium": "Veterinary Microbiology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel human coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|COVID-19|Animal coronaviruses|Genetic plasticity|Host switch|Tissue tropism", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082945922", "filename": "S0378113520302935_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common habits and life styles.

Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis.\nResults\n112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram.\nConclusions\nThe clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus.

The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language.\nStudy eligibility criteria\nInclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19.\nStudy appraisal and synthesis methods\nWe used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission.\nResults\n19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission.\nConclusion\nIn mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon.

Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity.

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.

"Abstract\nThe seventh novel human infecting Betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China. The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate.

Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1\u03b2 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1\u03b2 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1\u03b2, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K+, H+ and Ca2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes.", "language": "en", "handle": "Farag2020-Viroporins_and_inflammasomes-A_key_to_understand_virus-induced_inflammation"}, {"title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2014 Surveillance and testing in North England from 2012 to 2019", "authors": "Farooq, Hamzah Z.|Davies, Emma|Ahmad, Shazaad|Machin, Nicholas|Hesketh, Louise|Guiver, Malcolm|Turner, Andrew J.", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2020.01.043", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220300461", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus|MERS|MERS-CoV|High consequence infectious disease|HCID|Emerging infectious disease|EID|Public health epidemiological surveillance", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": "32004690", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081228203", "filename": "S1201971220300461_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and caused an epidemic in the Middle East.

The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans.

We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.

The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nConclusion\nAlthough, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals.

For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model \u2013 the \u201dRippled Newsvendor\u201d \u2013 with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and \u201dwear-and-tear\u201d (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model.

Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.\nFindings\nCountries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks.

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID\u00a0=\u00a08%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a050%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID\u00a0=\u00a09%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a044%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID\u00a0=\u00a06%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a048%) has to be placed in Category B.

Myocardial injury has a significant association with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury were relatively favorable.\u000bMeaning\u000bIt is reasonable to triage patients with COVID-19 according to the presence of underlying CVD and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment and even more aggressive strategies.\u000bImportance\u000bIncreasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce.\u000bObjective\u000bTo evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\u000bDesign, Setting, and Participants\u000bThis retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020.\u000bMain Outcomes and Measures\u000bDemographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels.\u000bResult\u000bAmong 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.530, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.613, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P\u2009=\u2009.001; P\u2009<\u2009.001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P\u2009=\u2009.96; P\u2009=\u2009.16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168).\u000bConclusions and Relevance\u000bMyocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow

Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R\n0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.\nFindings\nSimulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R\n0 of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R\n0 was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R\n0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R\n0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R\n0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R\n0 was 1\u00b75. For R\n0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.", "language": "en", "handle": "Hellewell2020-Feasibility_of_controlling_COVID-19_outbreaks_by_isolation_of_cases_and_contacts"}, {"title": "The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from a one health perspective", "authors": "Hemida, Maged Gomaa|Ba Abduallah, Mohammed M.", "date": "2020-03-16", "doi": "10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100127", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771420300185?v=s5", "medium": "One Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV|SARS-CoV-2|CoVID-19|MERS-CoV|Coronavirus|Outbreak|One health|Bats|Animal|Reservoir", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2352771420300185_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Medidas Generales de Prevenci\u00f3n"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China that is now reported in people on inhabited continents.

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold. As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese\u2013Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline.\nMethods\nThe national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world.\nResults\nWe presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients\u2019 disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases.\nConclusion\nTo control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.", "language": "en", "handle": "Ho2020-Highlights_of_traditional_Chinese_medicine_frontline_expert_advice_in_the_China_national_guideline_for_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Preventing intra-hospital infection and transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare workers", "authors": "Hoe GAN, Wee|Wah LIM, John|KOH, David", "date": "2020-03-24", "doi": "10.1016/j.shaw.2020.03.001", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209379112030161X?v=s5", "medium": "Safety and Health at Work", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus disease 2019|SEIPS|occupational health", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S209379112030161X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers.

Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia.\nAim and methods\nWe made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey.\nResults\nWe received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.\nConclusion\nThus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19.

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital.\nMethods\nTwo patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections.\nResults\nThrough contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season.

The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated.\nResults\nThe lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other \ufb01ndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calci\ufb01cation or lymphadelopathy were not observed.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients.\nParticipants and methods\nA total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes.\nResults\nBased on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis.\nConclusion\nChinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.", "language": "en", "handle": "Huang2020-Chinese_herbal_Huo-Gu_formula_for_the_treatment_of_steroid-associated_osteonecrosis_of_femoral_head-A_14-year_"}, {"title": "Clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China: A retrospective single center analysis", "authors": "Huang, Yihui|Tu, Mengqi|Wang, Shipei|Chen, Sichao|Zhou, Wei|Chen, Danyang|Zhou, Lin|Wang, Min|Zhao, Yan|Zeng, Wen|Huang, Qi|Xu, Hai'bo|Liu, Zeming|Guo, Liang", "date": "2020-02-27", "doi": "10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101606", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920300739", "medium": "Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|COVID-19|Wuhan", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85080040954", "filename": "S1477893920300739_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Huang2020-Clinical_characteristics_of_laboratory_confirmed_positive_cases_of_SARS-CoV-2_infection_in_Wuhan_China-A_retro"}, {"title": "Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China", "authors": "Huang, Chaolin|Wang, Yeming|Li, Xingwang|Ren, Lili|Zhao, Jianping|Hu, Yi|Zhang, Li|Fan, Guohui|Xu, Jiuyang|Gu, Xiaoying|Cheng, Zhenshun|Yu, Ting|Xia, Jiaan|Wei, Yuan|Wu, Wenjuan|Xie, Xuelei|Yin, Wen|Li, Hui|Liu, Min|Xiao, Yan|Gao, Hong|Guo, Li|Xie, Jungang|Wang, Guangfa|Jiang, Rongmeng|Gao, Zhancheng|Jin, Qi|Wang, Jianwei|Cao, Bin", "date": "2020-02-21", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620301835", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "31986264", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85078262578", "filename": "S0140673620301835_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49\u00b70 years (IQR 41\u00b70\u201358\u00b70). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8\u00b70 days [IQR 5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1.\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.\nMethods\nIn this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.\nResults\nSequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain \u03b2 (SBD\u03b2). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD\u03b2 of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.\nConclusions\nWe reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200\u00a0mg on day 1, followed by 100\u00a0mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in\u00a0vitro.

Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called \u201cI-cells\u201d. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited.

This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function).

Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).", "language": "en", "handle": "Jones2020-The_COVID-19_pandemic-Important_considerations_for_contact_lens_practitioners"}, {"title": "Understanding COVID-19: what does viral RNA load really mean?", "authors": "Joynt, Gavin M|Wu, William KK", "date": "2020-03-27", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30237-1", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302371", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302371_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Joynt2020-Understanding_COVID-19-what_does_viral_RNA_load_really_mean"}, {"title": "Recommended prophylactic and management strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in transplant recipients", "authors": "Ju, Chun-Rong|Lian, Qiao-Yan|Zhang, Jian-Heng|Qiu, Tao|Cai, Zhi-Tao|Jiang, Wen-Yang|Zhang, Jing|Cheng, Qin|Chen, Gang|Li, Ning|Wang, Chun-Yan|He, Jian-Xing", "date": "2020-03-27", "doi": "10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.02.003", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300165", "medium": "Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Corona virus disease 2019|Transplantation|Pneumonia|Recipients", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2095882X20300165_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Transplante"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nSince December 2019, increasing attention has been paid to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Wuhan, China.

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.\nMethods\nWe used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions).\nFindings\nOf 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5).\nInterpretation\nCountries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19.

However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.", "language": "en", "handle": "Kang2020-Impact_on_mental_health_and_perceptions_of_psychological_care_among_medical_and_nursing_staff_in_Wuhan_during_t"}, {"title": "Recent Progress in understanding 2019 Novel Coronavirus associated with Human Respiratory Disease: Detection, Mechanism and Treatment", "authors": "Kang, Shuntong|Peng, Wenyao|Zhu, Yuhao|Lu, Shiyao|Zhou, Min|Lin, Wei|Wu, Wenfang|Huang, Shu|Jiang, Liping|Luo, Xuan|Deng, Meichun", "date": "2020-03-29", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105950", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105950", "medium": "International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Mechanism|Treatment|Detection", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32234465", "scopus_id": null, "filename": "32234465.xml", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neumologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Viral respiratory diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), always pose severe threat to people.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.\nMethods\nWe adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R\n0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R\n0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00b77%, 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.\nFindings\nFor the baseline scenario, when R\n0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000), corresponding to 7\u00b74% (IQR 6\u00b75\u20138\u00b75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727\u2008000 cases (670\u2008000\u2013776\u2008000) when R\n0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u00b73% (17\u00b78\u201320\u00b76) of the Singaporean population, and 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) when R\n0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u00b79\u201333\u00b71) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when R\n0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77) when R\n0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u00b72% (59\u00b70 \u221294\u00b74) when R\n0 was 2\u00b75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00b70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R\n0 of 1\u00b75.\nInterpretation\nImplementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.\nFunding\nSingapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.", "language": "en", "handle": "Koo2020-Interventions_to_mitigate_early_spread_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_Singapore-a_modelling_study"}, {"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak: What the Department of Radiology Should Know", "authors": "Kooraki, Soheil|Hosseiny, Melina|Myers, Lee|Gholamrezanezhad, Ali", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacr.2020.02.008", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020301502", "medium": "Journal of the American College of Radiology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|COVID-19|pneumonia|infection control|safety", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32092296", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082304917", "filename": "S1546144020301502_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Radiologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R\nt) in Wuhan declined from 2\u00b735 (95% CI 1\u00b715\u20134\u00b777) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1\u00b705 (0\u00b741\u20132\u00b739) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R\nt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.", "language": "en", "handle": "Kucharski2020-Early_dynamics_of_transmission_and_control_of_COVID-19-a_mathematical_modelling_study"}, {"title": "Invisible spread of SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 Authors' reply", "authors": "Kucharski, Adam J|Eggo, Rosalind M", "date": "2020-04-08", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30275-9", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302759", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302759_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Kucharski2020-Invisible_spread_of_SARS-CoV-2_Authors_reply"}, {"title": "Identification, synthesis and evaluation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors", "authors": "Kumar, Vathan|Tan, Kian-Pin|Wang, Ying-Ming|Lin, Sheng-Wei|Liang, Po-Huang", "date": "2016-07-01", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2016.05.013", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089616303364", "medium": "Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "MERS-CoV|SARS-Cov|3CLpro|Coronavirus|Pyrazolone", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "27240464", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-84969980357", "filename": "S0968089616303364_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) led to a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia in late 2002.

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters.\nMethods\nWe have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country.

This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases.\nMethods\nand findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases.\nResults\nOur data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2=0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2=0.98, p<0.01).\nConclusions\nThe number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis.

In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers.

We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43\u201363), and 20 (58\u00b78%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91\u00b72%]), fatigue (25 [73\u00b75%]) and dry cough (18 [52\u00b79%]). 15 (44\u00b71%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20\u00b75%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury.\nInterpretation\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44\u00b71%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20\u00b75%.\nFunding\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China.", "language": "en", "handle": "Lei2020-Clinical_characteristics_and_outcomes_of_patients_undergoing_surgeries_during_the_incubation_period_of_COVID-19_"}, {"title": "Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series", "authors": "Lescure, Francois-Xavier|Bouadma, Lila|Nguyen, Duc|Parisey, Marion|Wicky, Paul-Henri|Behillil, Sylvie|Gaymard, Alexandre|Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude|Donati, Flora|Le Hingrat, Quentin|Enouf, Vincent|Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira|Valette, Martine|Mailles, Alexandra|Lucet, Jean-Christophe|Mentre, France|Duval, Xavier|Descamps, Diane|Malvy, Denis|Timsit, Jean-Franc\u0327ois|Lina, Bruno|van-der-Werf, Sylvie|Yazdanpanah, Yazdan", "date": "2020-03-27", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30200-0", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302000", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302000_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nOn Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.\nMethods\nIn this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.\nFindings\nThe patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00b72 and 7\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\nFunding\nREACTing (Research & Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).", "language": "en", "handle": "Lescure2020-Clinical_and_virological_data_of_the_first_cases_of_COVID-19_in_Europe-a_case_series"}, {"title": "Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics", "authors": "Leung, Gabriel M|Leung, Kathy", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30055-8", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750020300558", "medium": "The Lancet Digital Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079856428", "filename": "S2589750020300558_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Leung2020-Crowdsourcing_data_to_mitigate_epidemics"}, {"title": "Mass masking in the COVID-19 epidemic: people need guidance", "authors": "Leung, Chi Chiu|Lam, Tai Hing|Cheng, Kar Keung", "date": "2020-03-27", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30520-1", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305201", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32142626", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081645570", "filename": "S0140673620305201_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Equipo de Protecci\u00f3n Personal"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Leung2020-Mass_masking_in_the_COVID-19_epidemic-people_need_guidance"}, {"title": "Correspondence from Northern Italy about our experience with COVID-19", "authors": "Leva, Ernesto|Morandi, Anna|Sartori, Angelo|Macchini, Francesco|Berrettini, Alfredo|Manzoni, Gianantonio", "date": "2020-04-01", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2020.03.028", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346820302529", "medium": "Journal of Pediatric Surgery", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32278542", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083222374", "filename": "S0022346820302529_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Medidas Generales de Prevenci\u00f3n"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Leva2020-Correspondence_from_Northern_Italy_about_our_experience_with_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against COVID-19", "authors": "Lewnard, Joseph A|Lo, Nathan C", "date": "2020-03-23", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30190-0", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301900", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920301900_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Restricci\u00f3n circulaci\u00f3n ciudadanos"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Lewnard2020-Scientific_and_ethical_basis_for_social-distancing_interventions_against_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Effect of interferon alpha and cyclosporine treatment separately and in combination on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in a human in-vitro and ex-vivo culture model", "authors": "Li, H.S.|Kuok, Denise I.T.|Cheung, M.C.|Ng, Mandy M.T.|Ng, K.C.|Hui, Kenrie P.Y.|Peiris, J.S.Malik|Chan, Michael C.W.|Nicholls, John M.", "date": "2018-07-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.05.007", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218300949", "medium": "Antiviral Research", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)|Type I interferon|Cyclosporine|Ex vivo explants", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "29772254", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85047058929", "filename": "S0166354218300949_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Biol\u00f3gicos"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years.

We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication.

A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses' motivation to participate in disaster events.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nAn electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19.\nResults\nNine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD \u221231\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L; 95% CI, from \u221235 to \u221229\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L).

Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7007, P\u202f<\u202f0\u00b7001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7001, P\u202f<\u202f0\u00b7001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6\u20139 days after initial CT scans.\nInterpretation\nAtypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation.

We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 12 cities had average AH below 4\u00a0g/m3, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05\u00a0g/m3). Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study. Each 1\u00a0\u00b0C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively. For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014. In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14\u00a0days.

One month after the December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, we surveyed PTSS and sleep qualities among 285 residents in Wuhan and surrounding cities using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Hierarchical regression analysis and non-parametric test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%.

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries.\nMethods\nIn this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations.\nFindings\nWe focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen.\nInterpretation\nWith an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.\nFunding\nGeneral Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Key Project Grants of the National Science Foundation of China.", "language": "en", "handle": "Liu2020-What_are_the_Underlying_Transmission_Patterns_of_COVID-19_Outbreak_An_Age-specific_Social_Contact_Characterizati"}, {"title": "Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19?

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00b798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.", "language": "en", "handle": "Lu2020-Genomic_characterisation_and_epidemiology_of_2019_novel_coronavirus-implications_for_virus_origins_and_receptor_b"}, {"title": "Psychological status of medical workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study", "authors": "Lu, Wen|Wang, Hang|Lin, Yuxing|Li, Li", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112936", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120305850", "medium": "Psychiatry Research", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus pneumonia|Medical staff|Fear|Anxiety|Depression", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32276196", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083100253", "filename": "S0165178120305850_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Soporte Personal de Salud, Estudiantes y Sociedad"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has burdened an unprecedented psychological stress on people around the world, especially\u00a0the medical workforce.

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \u201cimmune enhancement\u201d). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

with coronavirus disease 2019, neurologic symptoms were seen in 36.4% of patients and were more common in patients with severe infection (45.5%) according to their respiratory status, which included acute cerebrovascular events, impaired consciousness, and muscle injury.\u000bMeaning\u000bNeurologic symptoms manifest in a notable proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.\u000bImportance\u000bThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is serious and has the potential to become an epidemic worldwide. Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations.\u000bObjective\u000bTo study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19.\u000bDesign, Setting, and Participants\u000bThis is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\u000bMain Outcomes and Measures\u000bClinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations.\u000bResults\u000bOf 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).\u000bConclusions and Relevance\u000bPatients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.\u000bThis study investigates the neurologic manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.", "language": "en", "handle": "Mao2020-Neurologic_Manifestations_of_Hospitalized_Patients_With_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_in_Wuhan_China"}, {"title": "Use of a modified

and pandemic viral infection including influenza, HIV and COVID-19. Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of \u201cspecific\u201d vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treatment of viral infection. However, it takes 12\u201318\u202fmonths till the effective vaccine becomes available. Until then ventilator (O2 supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients. Thus, as alternative potentially more direct \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.", "language": "en", "handle": "Maruta2020-PAK1-blockers-Potential_Therapeutics_against_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Treatment for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19", "authors": "Matthay, Michael A|Aldrich, J Matthew|Gotts, Jeffrey E", "date": "2020-03-20", "doi": "10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30127-2", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260020301272", "medium": "The Lancet Respiratory Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32203709", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082804589", "filename": "S2213260020301272_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neumologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Matthay2020-Treatment_for_severe_acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_from_COVID-19"}, {"title": "\u00bfVa a cambiar la neurologi\u0301a tras la pandemia de Covid-19 en los pro\u0301ximos cinco an\u0303os?.

This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe.

The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy.\nMethod\nWe searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS.\nResults\nInitial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy.\nConclusion\nDespite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings.", "language": "en", "handle": "Momattin2019-A_Systematic_Review_of_therapeutic_agents_for_the_treatment_of_the_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronav"}, {"title": "The emotional impact of COVID-19: From medical staff to common people", "authors": "Montemurro, Nicola", "date": "2020-03-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.032", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120304116", "medium": "Brain, Behavior, and Immunity", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV|Coronavirus|COVID-19|Mental health|Neuroscience", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0889159120304116_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Montemurro2020-The_emotional_impact_of_COVID-19-From_medical_staff_to_common_people"}, {"title": "Recomendaciones pra\u0301cticas para el manejo perioperatorio del paciente con sospecha o infeccio\u0301n grave por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2", "authors": "Montero Feijoo, A.|Maseda, E.|Adalia Bartolome\u0301, R.|Aguilar, G.|Gonza\u0301lez de Castro, R.|Go\u0301mez-Herreras, J.I.|Garci\u0301a Palenciano, C.|Pereira, J.|Ramasco Rueda, F.|Samso, E.|Sua\u0301rez de la Rica, A.|Tamayo Medel, G.|Varela Dura\u0301n, M.", "date": "2020-05-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.003", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034935620300530", "medium": "Revista Espan\u0303ola de Anestesiologi\u0301a y Reanimacio\u0301n", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Infeccio\u0301n|Virus|Quiro\u0301fano|Recomendacio\u0301n|Infection|Virus|Operating room|Recommendation", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081924823", "filename": "S0034935620300530_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "abstract": "Resumen\nEn diciembre del 2019, la Comisi\u00f3n Municipal de Salud y Sanidad de Wuhan (provincia de Hubei, China) inform\u00f3 de una serie de casos de neumon\u00eda de etiolog\u00eda desconocida.

In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care.

However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the etiology of NHAP was considered to be similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the \u201cantibiotic time out\u201d protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen.

To date, COVID-19 has affected over 944,181 people worldwide, resulting in over 47,312 reported deaths. Numerous preventative strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been employed to mitigate the spread of disease including careful infection control, the isolation of patients, and social distancing. Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate.

However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMethods\nWe used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.\nFindings\nThe weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22\u201364) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b74) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22\u201367) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18\u201368) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0\u201342) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.\nInterpretation\nEstimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.\nFunding\nUS National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Fellowship Foundation Ramon Areces.", "language": "en", "handle": "Niehus2020-Using_observational_data_to_quantify_bias_of_traveller-derived_COVID-19_prevalence_estimates_in_Wuhan_China"}, {"title": "Urban inequalities in the 21st century economy", "authors": "Nijman, Jan|Wei, Yehua Dennis", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622820301910", "medium": "Applied Geography", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Urban inequality|New economy|Spatial inequality|Spatiality|Scale", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0143622820301910_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Experiencias, Percepciones, Consecuencias"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the last decade or so, inequality studies have assumed renewed prominence across the social sciences.

Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales.

According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines\u2019 and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.", "language": "en", "handle": "Nikolaou2020-Identification_of_critical_airports_for_controlling_global_infectious_disease_outbreaks-Stress-tests_focusi"}, {"title": "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections", "authors": "Nishiura, Hiroshi|Linton, Natalie M.|Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220301193", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|Outbreak|Illness onset|Generation time|Statistical model|Epidemiology|Viruses", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": "32145466", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081989464", "filename": "S1201971220301193_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective\nTo estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.\nMethods\nWe collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18).

The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control.

In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\nMethods\nPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\nResults\nOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2032-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2032-part spanning 24,341\u201330,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2032-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\nConclusions\nThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

The objective of this paper is to critically review the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience regarding COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hebei and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and non-essential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. While some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers and contacts, and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organized, proactive and unified strategy at a national level.

However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%).

The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0\u20132.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7\u20131.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation.\nImplications\nThere is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level.

Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU.\nConclusions\nICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.\nMethods\nTo examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).\nFindings\nOur projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66\u201397) and 24% (13\u201390) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.\nInterpretation\nRestrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R\n0 and the duration of infectiousness.\nFunding\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institute for Health Research, Wellcome Trust, and Health Data Research UK.", "language": "en", "handle": "Prem2020-The_effect_of_control_strategies_to_reduce_social_mixing_on_outcomes_of_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_Wuhan_China-a_"}, {"title": "COVID-19 and immunomodulator/immunosuppressant use in dermatology", "authors": "Price, Kyla N.|Frew, John W.|Hsiao, Jennifer L.|Shi, Vivian Y.", "date": "2020-05-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.046", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220304667", "medium": "Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0190962220304667_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Dermatolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Price2020-COVID-19_and_immunomodulator_immunosuppressant_use_in_dermatology"}, {"title": "Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures", "authors": "Pung, Rachael|Chiew, Calvin J|Young, Barnaby E|Chin, Sarah|Chen, Mark I-C|Clapham, Hannah E|Cook, Alex R|Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian|Toh, Matthias P H S|Poh, Cuiqin|Low, Mabel|Lum, Joshua|Koh, Valerie T J|Mak, Tze M|Cui, Lin|Lin, Raymond V T P|Heng, Derrick|Leo, Yee-Sin|Lye, David C|Lee, Vernon J M|Kam, Kai-qian|Kalimuddin, Shirin|Tan, Seow Yen|Loh, Jiashen|Thoon, Koh Cheng|Vasoo, Shawn|Khong, Wei Xin|Suhaimi, Nur-Afidah|Chan, Sherlynn JH|Zhang, Emma|Oh, Olivia|Ty, Albert|Tow, Charlene|Chua, Yi Xian|Chaw, Wei Liang|Ng, Yixiang|Abdul-Rahman, Farid|Sahib, Shafiq|Zhao, Zheng|Tang, Cheryl|Low, Constance|Goh, Ee Hui|Lim, Georgina|Hou, Yan'an|Roshan, Imran|Tan, James|Foo, Kelly|Nandar, Khine|Kurupatham, Lalitha|Chan, Pei Pei|Raj, Pream|Lin, Yijun|Said, Zubaidah|Lee, Anne|See, Cherie|Markose, Jessey|Tan, Joanna|Chan, Guanhao|See, Wanhan|Peh, Xinyi|Cai, Vincent|Chen, Wen Kai|Li, Zongbin|Soo, Roy|Chow, Angela LP|Wei, Wycliffe|Farwin, Aysha|Ang, Li Wei", "date": "2020-04-03", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30528-6", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305286", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32192580", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082423866", "filename": "S0140673620305286_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nThree clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.\nMethods\nWe gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning.\u000bMethods\u000bThe spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus.\u000bResults\u000bThe 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g\u2009=\u20093) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual.\u000bConclusions\u000bThe optimal feature (GGAP, g\u2009=\u20093) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner.

Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019\u2019s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of \u223c5 days (range, 2\u201314 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49\u201356 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54\u201373%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be \u223c1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.\nData on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks\u2019 gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30\u2008000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3\u20134 days, departing from the exponential trend.

KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5\u201392.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8\u201374.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9\u201380.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0\u201330.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7\u201351.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1\u20139.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2\u201321.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.\nWe use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.\nOur most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409\u20137496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128\u20131929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.

The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.\nResults\nLH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.

Definition of cardiac injury follows that of the included studies, which includes highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnl) >99th percentile.The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were ARDS, the need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. ARDS and severe COVID-19 were defined per the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) of COVID-19.\nResults\nThere were a total of 2389 patients from 13 studies. This meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (RR 7.95 [5.12, 12.34], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; I2: 65%).

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%\u2013~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF\u03baB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.", "language": "en", "handle": "Shannon2020-Remdesivir_and_SARS-CoV-2-structural_requirements_at_both_nsp12_RdRp_and_nsp14_Exonuclease_active-sites"}, {"title": "In-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China", "authors": "Shao, Fei|Xu, Shuang|Ma, Xuedi|Xu, Zhouming|Lyu, Jiayou|Ng, Michael|Cui, Hao|Yu, Changxiao|Zhang, Qing|Sun, Peng|Tang, Ziren", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.005", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957220301428", "medium": "Resuscitation", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "In-hospital cardiac arrest|Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|COVID-19|ROSC|Survival", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0300957220301428_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Cardiolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective\nTo describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China.\nMethods\nThe outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated.

Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.\nFindings\n81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11\u00b70).

To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.\nMethods\nThe daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.\nResults\nWe identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19.

Currently, detailed pathologic examination of kidney damage in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been lacking. To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules. In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis. Thus, our studies provide direct evidence of the invasion of SARSCoV-2 into kidney tissue.

Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.\nMethods\nIn this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.\nFindings\nWe collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35\u201360). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0\u00b70009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5\u00b72%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health.", "language": "en", "handle": "Sun2020-Early_epidemiological_analysis_of_the_coronavirus_disease_2019_outbreak_based_on_crowdsourced_data-a_population-"}, {"title": "Custom-made 3D-printed face masks in case of pandemic crisis situations with a lack of commercially available FFP2/3 masks", "authors": "Swennen, Gwen R.J.|Pottel, Lies|Haers, Piet E.", "date": "2020-04-02", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2020.03.015", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0901502720301235", "medium": "International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Reusable face mask|Face scanning|3D printing|FFP2/3|COVID-19|Pandemic", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0901502720301235_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Equipo de Protecci\u00f3n Personal"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur. A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission. Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever. In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated. In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal. All were treated with symptomatic support without complications.\nConclusion\nOur findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children.

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease.

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak.

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00b72 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71\u20137\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \u22120\u00b715, 95% CI \u22120\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b711; R\n2=0\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074\u20130\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R\n2>0\u00b79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.

Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery\u2013go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer\u2013colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma\u2013morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery.

novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.", "language": "en", "handle": "Vellingiri2020-COVID-19-A_promising_cure_for_the_global_panic"}, {"title": "Breakthrough of COVID-19 using radiotherapy treatment modalities", "authors": "Venkatraman, P.|Sahay, Joshua|Maidili, T.|Rajan, Rajisha|Pooja, S.", "date": "2020-04-20", "doi": "10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.024", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016781402030205X?v=s5", "medium": "Radiotherapy and Oncology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S016781402030205X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Otros"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Venkatraman2020-Breakthrough_of_COVID-19_using_radiotherapy_treatment_modalities"}, {"title": "Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis", "authors": "Verity, Robert|Okell, Lucy C|Dorigatti, Ilaria|Winskill, Peter|Whittaker, Charles|Imai, Natsuko|Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina|Thompson, Hayley|Walker, Patrick G T|Fu, Han|Dighe, Amy|Griffin, Jamie T|Baguelin, Marc|Bhatia, Sangeeta|Boonyasiri, Adhiratha|Cori, Anne|Cucunuba\u0301, Zulma|FitzJohn, Rich|Gaythorpe, Katy|Green, Will|Hamlet, Arran|Hinsley, Wes|Laydon, Daniel|Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma|Riley, Steven|van Elsland, Sabine|Volz, Erik|Wang, Haowei|Wang, Yuanrong|Xi, Xiaoyue|Donnelly, Christl A|Ghani, Azra C|Ferguson, Neil M", "date": "2020-03-30", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302437", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302437_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17\u00b78 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16\u00b79\u201319\u00b72) and to hospital discharge to be 24\u00b77 days (22\u00b79\u201328\u00b71). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70\u2008117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3\u00b767% (95% CrI 3\u00b756\u20133\u00b780). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1\u00b738% (1\u00b723\u20131\u00b753), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0\u00b732% [0\u00b727\u20130\u00b738] in those aged <60 years vs 6\u00b74% [5\u00b77\u20137\u00b72] in those aged \u226560 years), up to 13\u00b74% (11\u00b72\u201315\u00b79) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1\u00b74% [0\u00b74\u20133\u00b75] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4\u00b75% [1\u00b78\u201311\u00b71] in those aged \u226560 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0\u00b766% (0\u00b739\u20131\u00b733), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18\u00b74% (11\u00b70\u20137\u00b76) in those aged 80 years or older.\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council.", "language": "en", "handle": "Verity2020-Estimates_of_the_severity_of_coronavirus_disease_2019-a_model-based_analysis"}, {"title": "Everything old is new again: COVID-19 and public health", "authors": "Vessey, Judith A.|Betz, Cecily L.", "date": "2020-03-26", "doi": "10.1016/j.pedn.2020.03.014", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596320302050", "medium": "Journal of Pediatric Nursing", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0882596320302050_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Vessey2020-Everything_old_is_new_again-COVID-19_and_public_health"}, {"title": "Patients with advanced basal cell carcinomas in treatment with sonic hedgehog inhibitors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period: Management and adherence to treatment", "authors": "Villani, Alessia|Fabbrocini, Gabriella|Costa, Claudia|Scalvenzi, Massimiliano", "date": "2020-03-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.057", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220304795?v=s5", "medium": "Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0190962220304795_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Dermatolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Villani2020-Patients_with_advanced_basal_cell_carcinomas_in_treatment_with_sonic_hedgehog_inhibitors_during_the_coronavi"}, {"title": "School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review", "authors": "Viner, Russell M|Russell, Simon J|Croker, Helen|Packer, Jessica|Ward, Joseph|Stansfield, Claire|Mytton, Oliver|Bonell, Chris|Booy, Robert", "date": "2020-04-06", "doi": "10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30095-X", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235246422030095X", "medium": "The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S235246422030095X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Restricciones colegios - universidades"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Summary\nIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2\u20134% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.", "language": "en", "handle": "Viner2020-School_closure_and_management_practices_during_coronavirus_outbreaks_including_COVID-19-a_rapid_systematic_rev"}, {"title": "Working through the COVID-19 outbreak: Rapid review and recommendations for MSK and allied heath personnel", "authors": "Viswanath, Aparna|Monga, Puneet", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcot.2020.03.014", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976566220300977", "medium": "Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Personal protective equipment|Facemasks", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082798541", "filename": "S0976566220300977_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Medidas Generales de Prevenci\u00f3n"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to undergo unprecedented change in a short space of time.

Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.\u000bResults\u000bOf 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u200936), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.

The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors.\nResults\n339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71\u00b18 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead.

PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6\u202fdays). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.", "language": "en", "handle": "Wang2020-Real-time_estimation_and_prediction_of_mortality_caused_by_COVID-19_with_patient_information_based_algorithm"}, {"title": "Risk of COVID-19 for patients with cancer", "authors": "Wang, Hanping|Zhang, Li", "date": "2020-04-30", "doi": "10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30149-2", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204520301492", "medium": "The Lancet Oncology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32142621", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082405973", "filename": "S1470204520301492_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Oncolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": null, "language": "en", "handle": "Wang2020-Risk_of_COVID-19_for_patients_with_cancer"}, {"title": "Severe air pollution events not avoided by reduced anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 outbreak", "authors": "Wang, Pengfei|Chen, Kaiyu|Zhu, Shengqiang|Wang, Peng|Zhang, Hongliang", "date": "2020-07-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092134492030135X", "medium": "Resources, Conservation and Recycling", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Severe air pollution|Emission reduction|Meteorology|China", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082178451", "filename": "S092134492030135X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nDue to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively.

The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable.

Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.\nStudy design\nThe study design is a rapid evidence review.\nMethods\nWe searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak.\nResults\nWe found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work.\nConclusions\nPeople vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.

For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82\u2008000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.\nMethods\nWe performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.\nFindings\nRegardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589\u00b75, 49\u00b73, and 37\u00b75 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2\u00b72 million.\nInterpretation\nImplementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.", "language": "en", "handle": "Wu2020-Facemask_shortage_and_the_novel_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_outbreak-Reflections_on_public_health_measures"}, {"title": "Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China", "authors": "Wu, Aiping|Peng, Yousong|Huang, Baoying|Ding, Xiao|Wang, Xianyue|Niu, Peihua|Meng, Jing|Zhu, Zhaozhong|Zhang, Zheng|Wang, Jiangyuan|Sheng, Jie|Quan, Lijun|Xia, Zanxian|Tan, Wenjie|Cheng, Genhong|Jiang, Taijiao", "date": "2020-03-11", "doi": "10.1016/j.chom.2020.02.001", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131282030072X", "medium": "Cell Host & Microbe", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": "32035028", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079051459", "filename": "S193131282030072X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "An in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\u201324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\u00b768 (95% CrI 2\u00b747\u20132\u00b786) and that 75\u2008815 individuals (95% CrI 37\u2008304\u2013130\u2008330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\u00b74 days (95% CrI 5\u00b78\u20137\u00b71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\u2013805), 113 (57\u2013193), 98 (49\u2013168), 111 (56\u2013191), and 80 (40\u2013139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u20132 weeks.\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).", "language": "en", "handle": "Wu2020-Nowcasting_and_forecasting_the_potential_domestic_and_international_spread_of_the_2019-nCoV_outbreak_originating_"}, {"title": "Positive effects of COVID-19 control measures on influenza prevention", "authors": "Wu, Di|Lu, Jianyun|Liu, Yanhui|Zhang, Zhoubin|Luo, Lei", "date": "2020-06-30", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.009", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302253", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|Influenza|Control", "open_access_license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1201971220302253_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Medidas Generales de Prevenci\u00f3n"], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic threat to the whole world.

A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail.\nResults\nThe exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3\u00a0\u00b0C and became flat above 3\u00a0\u00b0C. When mean temperature (lag0\u201314) was below 3\u00a0\u00b0C, each 1\u00a0\u00b0C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209\u20136.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases.

The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems.

The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020.\nFindings\nA total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later.\nInterpretation\nMost patients presented with a mild infection in our study.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00b75%) patients.\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002\u20132003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.", "language": "en", "handle": "Yang2020-The_deadly_coronaviruses-The_2003_SARS_pandemic_and_the_2020_novel_coronavirus_epidemic_in_China"}, {"title": "The diagnostic and predictive role of NLR, d-NLR and PLR in COVID-19 patients", "authors": "Yang, Ai-Ping|Liu, Jianping|Tao, Wenqiang|Li, Hui-ming", "date": "2020-04-13", "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106504", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156757692030494X?v=s5", "medium": "International Immunopharmacology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio|platelet-to-LYM ratio|predictive|age", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S156757692030494X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Medicina Interna"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nAim\nTo accumulate evidence that indicates the key role played by virus-triggered inflammation in the 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan City and rapidly spread throughout China.\nMethods\nAge, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte(MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and C-reactive protein(CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared.

Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals.\nAlthough TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals.\nThese enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.

Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase (lag0\u201314) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively.

With TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 [2.21-4.11] for Italy, 6.56 [2.04-12.26] for France, 4.43 [1.83-7.92] for Germany, and 3.95 [0-10.19] for Spain.\nConclusions\nThis study provides important findings on an early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority", "language": "en", "handle": "Yuan2020-Monitoring_Transmissibility_and_Mortality_of_COVID-19_in_Europe"}, {"title": "Laboratory data analysis of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) screening in 2510 patients", "authors": "Yun, Hu|Sun, Zhuoran|Wu, Jun|Tang, Aiguo|Hu, Min|Xiang, Zhongyuan", "date": "2020-08-31", "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.018", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000989812030173X", "medium": "Clinica Chimica Acta", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Influenza A|Influenza B|Laboratory data|Hematology index", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S000989812030173X_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Infectologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nNovel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment. We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice.\nMethod\nWe collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis.\nResult\nCOVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nConclusion\nThe positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions.\nPatients and Methods\nRadiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches.\nResults\nRecommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation.\nConclusion\nResources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.", "language":

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010).\nConclusions\nCancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection. It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.", "language": "en", "handle": "Zhang2020-Clinical_characteristics_of_COVID-19-infected_cancer_patients-A_retrospective_case_study_in_three_hospitals_wi"}, {"title": "Corona Virus International Public Health Emergencies: Implications for Radiology Management", "authors": "Zhang, Han-Wen|Yu, Juan|Xu, Hua-Jian|Lei, Yi|Pu, Zu-Hui|Dai, Wei-Cai|Lin, Fan|Wang, Yu-Li|Wu, Xiao-Liu|Liu, Li-Hong|Li, Min|Mo, Yong-Qian|Zhang, Hong|Luo, Si-Ping|Chen, Huan|Lyu, Gui-Wen|Zhou, Zhao-Guang|Liu, Wei-Min|Liu, Xiao-Lei|Song, Hai-Yan|Chen, Fu-Zhen|Zeng, Liang|Zhong, Hua|Guo, Ting-Ting|Hu, Ya-Qiong|Yang, Xin-Xin|Liu, Pin-Ni|Li, Ding-Fu", "date": "2020-02-26", "doi": "10.1016/j.acra.2020.02.003", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633220300891", "medium": "Academic Radiology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "2019-nCoV|COVID-19|WHO|PHEIC|radiology management", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85080026376", "filename": "S1076633220300891_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Radiologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread internationally.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.\nMethods\nWe collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R\nt) at the provincial level.\nFindings\nWe collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33\u201356), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00b76 days (0\u00b70\u20139\u00b70) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5\u00b72 days (1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00b71 days (1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1\u00b708 (95% CI 0\u00b774\u20131\u00b754) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1\u00b771 (1\u00b732\u20132\u00b717) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30.\nInterpretation\nOur estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.\nFunding\nNational Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and European Commission Horizon 2020.", "language": "en", "handle": "Zhang2020-Evolving_epidemiology_and_transmission_dynamics_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_outside_Hubei_province_China-a_des"}, {"title": "Identification of Kidney Transplant Recipients with Coronavirus Disease 2019", "authors": "Zhang, Hui|Chen, Yan|Yuan, Quan|Xia, Qiu-Xiang|Zeng, Xian-Peng|Peng, Jing-Tao|Liu, Jing|Xiao, Xing-Yuan|Jiang, Guo-Song|Xiao, Han-Yu|Xie, Liang-Bo|Chen, Jing|Liu, Jia-Li|Xiao, Xiong|Su, Hua|Zhang, Chun|Zhang, Xiao-Ping|Yang, Hua|Li, Heng|Wang, Zhen-Di", "date": "2020-04-02", "doi": "10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283820302050", "medium": "European Urology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Clinical feature|Coronavirus disease 2019|Kidney transplant recipient", "open_access_license": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0302283820302050_meta.json", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Transplante"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and lethal infectious disease, posing a threat to global health security.

Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et\u00a0al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

The infection may result into severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias.\u000bMethods\u000bNineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.\u000bResults\u000bAll patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images.

Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703\u20131\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761\u201312\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764\u2013128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70\u201324\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay.\nSpecialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources.\nInpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum.\nIn order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively.

Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds.
