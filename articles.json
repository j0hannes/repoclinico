The number of deaths reached 12\u00a0784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%. Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in\u00a0vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.

This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus.

Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students\u2019 perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak.\nMethods\nWe randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed.\nResults\nOne hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 \u00b1 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 \u00b1 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1\u201310 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV.\nConclusions\nMedical students\u2019 psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately.

imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nResults\nModerate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes.\nConclusions\nAlthough only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Alifano2020-Renin-angiotensin_system_at_the_heart_of_COVID-19_pandemic"}, {"title": "Integrative considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720301130", "doi": "10.1016/j.explore.2020.03.007", "date": "2020-03-26", "authors": "Alschuler, Lise|Weil, Andrew|Horwitz, Randy|Stamets, Paul|Chiasson, Ann Marie|Crocker, Robert|Maizes, Victoria", "medium": "EXPLORE", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1550830720301130_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Alschuler2020-Integrative_considerations_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}, {"title": "Evidence informing the UK's COVID-19 public health response must be transparent", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067362030667X", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30667-X", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": "Alwan, Nisreen A|Bhopal, Raj|Burgess, Rochelle A|Colburn, Tim|Cuevas, Luis E|Smith, George Davey|Egger, Matthias|Eldridge, Sandra|Gallo, Valentina|Gilthorpe, Mark S|Greenhalgh, Trish|Griffiths, Christopher|Hunter, Paul R|Jaffar, Shabbar|Jepson, Ruth|Low, Nicola|Martineau, Adrian|McCoy, David|Orcutt, Miriam|Pankhania, Bharat|Pikhart, Hynek|Pollock, Allyson|Scally, Gabriel|Smith, James|Sridhar, Devi|Taylor, Stephanie|Tennant, Peter W G|Themistocleous, Yrene|Wilson, Anne", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32197104", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082560934", "filename": "S014067362030667X_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Alwan2020-Evidence_informing_the_UK_s_COVID-19_public_health_response_must_be_transparent"}, {"title": "Responding to natural disasters vs. disease outbreaks: Do emergency medical service providers have different views?", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919312646", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Alwidyan, Mahmoud T.|Trainor, Joseph E.|Bissell, Richard A.", "medium": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Disease outbreaks|Emergency medical services|Prehospital emergency care|Reporting for duty", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85076629946", "filename": "S2212420919312646_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nOur planet has been experiencing a huge burden of natural disasters and public health emergencies in the last three decades.

This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers\u2019 views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions.\nMethods\nThis study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach.\nResults\nThree themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences. For disease outbreaks, however, the two themes were concerned and no additional risk. While participants expressed varying concerns about working during disasters and pandemic conditions, everyone felt willing and obligated to come to work despite the perceived high risk for some of them to work in some conditions.\nConclusion\nThis study helps to provide the base upon which EMS, public health, and emergency management agencies can formulate actions that emerged from the views of EMS providers concerning work during disasters and public health emergencies.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Alwidyan2020-Responding_to_natural_disasters_vs_disease_outbreaks-Do_emergency_medical_service_providers_have_different_"}, {"title": "SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Status Report", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301205", "doi": "10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007", "date": "2020-04-06", "authors": "Amanat, Fatima|Krammer, Florian", "medium": "Immunity", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1074761320301205_meta.json", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China.

For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians.\nWe discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Ansari2020-Deliberate_release-Plague_A_review"}, {"title": "The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: how the Italian public is being informed", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X2030183X", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.037", "date": "2020-04-01", "authors": "Antonelli, G.|Capobianchi, M.R.|Riva, E.", "medium": "Clinical Microbiology and Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32246996", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083489511", "filename": "S1198743X2030183X_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Antonelli2020-The_SARS-CoV-2_epidemic-how_the_Italian_public_is_being_informed"}, {"title": "Macrolides in critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219300529", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2019.01.041", "date": "2019-04-30", "authors": "Arabi, Yaseen M.|Deeb, Ahmad M.|Al-Hameed, Fahad|Mandourah, Yasser|Almekhlafi, Ghaleb A.|Sindi, Anees A.|Al-Omari, Awad|Shalhoub, Sarah|Mady, Ahmed|Alraddadi, Basem|Almotairi, Abdullah|Al Khatib, Kasim|Abdulmomen, Ahmed|Qushmaq, Ismael|Solaiman, Othman|Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M.|Al-Raddadi, Rajaa|Ragab, Ahmad|Al Harthy, Abdulrahman|Kharaba, Ayman|Jose, Jesna|Dabbagh, Tarek|Fowler, Robert A.|Balkhy, Hanan H.|Merson, Laura|Hayden, Frederick G.", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Macrolides|MERS-CoV|Critical care|Pneumonia|Influenza|Azithromycin", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": "30690213", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85062352179", "filename": "S1201971219300529_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives\nMacrolides have been reported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with viral pneumonia related to influenza and other viruses, possibly because of their immune-modulatory effects. Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS.\nMethods\nThis retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance.\nResults\nOf 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P\n=0.02). Macrolide therapy was not independently associated with a significant difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.47\u20131.51; P\n=0.56) or MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR: 0.88; 95% CI:0.47\u20131.64; P\n=0.68).\nConclusions\nThese findings indicate that macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in 90-day mortality or improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Infectologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Arabi2019-Macrolides_in_critically_ill_patients_with_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome"}, {"title": "The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u2014An emerging global health threat", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120303658", "doi": "10.1016/j.jiph.2020.02.033", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Arshad Ali, Shajeea|Baloch, Mariam|Ahmed, Naseem|Arshad Ali, Asadullah|Iqbal, Ayman", "medium": "Journal of Infection and Public Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Public health|Infectious disease|Pandemic|Zoonotic transmission", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": "32199792", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082404937", "filename": "S1876034120303658_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), has affected the lives of 71,429 people globally.

The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical.

Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to enable different levels of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment among different doctors from different hospitals to upgrade to the national and international through the intelligent assistance of the nCapp system. In this way, we can block disease transmission, avoid physician infection, and epidemic prevention and control as soon as possible.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Diagn\u00f3stico"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Bai2020-Chinese_experts_consensus_on_the_Internet_of_Things-aided_diagnosis_and_treatment_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_CO"}, {"title": "Essential care of critical illness must not be forgotten in the COVID-19 pandemic", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620307935", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30793-5", "date": "2020-04-01", "authors": "Baker, Tim|Schell, Carl Otto|Petersen, Dan Brun|Sawe, Hendry|Khalid, Karima|Mndolo, Samson|Rylance, Jamie|McAuley, Daniel F|Roy, Nobhojit|Marshall, John|Wallis, Lee|Molyneux, Elizabeth", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0140673620307935_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["UCI Anestesia"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Baker2020-Essential_care_of_critical_illness_must_not_be_forgotten_in_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}, {"title": "Molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in the first COVID-19 cluster in France reveals an amino acid deletion in nsp2 (Asp268del)", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20301658", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.020", "date": "2020-03-28", "authors": "Bal, A.|Destras, G.|Gaymard, A.|Bouscambert-Duchamp, M.|Valette, M.|Escuret, V.|Frobert, E.|Billaud, G.|Trouillet-Assant, S.|Cheynet, V.|Brengel-Pesce, K.|Morfin, F.|Lina, B.|Josset, L.", "medium": "Clinical Microbiology and Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1198743X20301658_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Bal2020-Molecular_characterization_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_the_first_COVID-19_cluster_in_France_reveals_an_amino_acid_deletion_"}, {"title": "Manejo quir\u00fargico de pacientes con infecci\u00f3n por COVID-19.

Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8\u201312% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients.\nConclusions\nMost of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd\nof 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases.

Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course.

However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention.

In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency.

In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization.\nMethods\nMultidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens.\nResults\nSubstantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective.\nConclusion\nIn the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Oncolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Gu\u00edas de Pr\u00e1ctica Cl\u00ednica", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Braunstein2020-Breast_radiotherapy_under_COVID-19_pandemic_resource_constraints_--_approaches_to_defer_or_shorten_treatm"}, {"title": "Effects of hand disinfection with alcohol hand rub, ozonized water or soap water \u2013 time for reconsideration?", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120301134?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.014", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": "Breidablik, H.J.|Lysebo, D.E.|Johannesse, L.|Skare, \u00c5.|Kleiven, O.|Andersen, J.R.", "medium": "Journal of Hospital Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0195670120301134_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nWe tested the effect of alcohol hand rub in eradicating Escherichia coli, and compared it with hand wash using ozonized tap water or soap and water.

In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice.

More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%\u20132%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600\u00a0mg twice daily; Days 2\u201314: 600\u00a0mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1\u201314: 400\u00a0mg/100\u00a0mg twice daily) plus IFN-\u03b1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5\u20139) d versus 11 (8\u201313) d, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Antivirales"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Cai2020-Experimental_Treatment_with_Favipiravir_for_COVID-19-An_Open-Label_Control_Study"}, {"title": "Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221326002030117X", "doi": "10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30117-X", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Cai, Hua", "medium": "The Lancet Respiratory Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32171067", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082404669", "filename": "S221326002030117X_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Cai2020-Sex_difference_and_smoking_predisposition_in_patients_with_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620304189", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30418-9", "date": "2020-03-13", "authors": "Calisher, Charles|Carroll, Dennis|Colwell, Rita|Corley, Ronald B|Daszak, Peter|Drosten, Christian|Enjuanes, Luis|Farrar, Jeremy|Field, Hume|Golding, Josie|Gorbalenya, Alexander|Haagmans, Bart|Hughes, James M|Karesh, William B|Keusch, Gerald T|Lam, Sai Kit|Lubroth, Juan|Mackenzie, John S|Madoff, Larry|Mazet, Jonna|Palese, Peter|Perlman, Stanley|Poon, Leo|Roizman, Bernard|Saif, Linda|Subbarao, Kanta|Turner, Mike", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32087122", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85080904688", "filename": "S0140673620304189_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Experiencias, Percepciones, Consecuencias"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Calisher2020-Statement_in_support_of_the_scientists_public_health_professionals_and_medical_professionals_of_China_comba"}, {"title": "Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420301706?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.019", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Calton, Brook|Abedini, Nauzley|Fratkin, Michael", "medium": "Journal of Pain and Symptom Management", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "telemedicine|telehealth|COVID-19|coronavirus|video visits", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0885392420301706_meta.json", "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWithin weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it.

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection.

No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36\u201366 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3\u20136 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6\u201310 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.

Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P\u00a0<0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10\u201312 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P\u00a0<0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]\u202f=\u202f1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR\u202f=\u202f0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.\nConclusions\nThe majority of COVID-19 cases are mild.

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55\u00b75 years (SD 13\u00b71), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.

We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible.

Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+\u223c3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+\u223c3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Nefrolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Cheng2020-Kidney_disease_is_associated_with_in-hospital_death_of_patients_with_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Gastrointestinal Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Virus Load in Fecal Samples from the Hong Kong Cohort and Systematic Review and Meta-analysis", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508520304480?v=s5", "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.065", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": "Cheung, Ka Shing|Hung, Ivan FN.|Chan, Pierre PY.|Lung, K.C.|Tso, Eugene|Liu, Raymond|Ng, Y.Y.|Chu, Man Y.|Chung, Tom WH.|Tam, Anthony Raymond|Yip, Cyril CY.|Leung, Kit-Hang|Yim-Fong Fung, Agnes|Zhang, Ricky R.|Lin, Yansheng|Cheng, Ho Ming|Zhang, Anna JX.|To, Kelvin KW.|Chan, Kwok-H.|Yuen, Kwok-Y.|Leung, Wai K.", "medium": "Gastroenterology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "PRISMA|SARS|viral persistence|fecal to oral transmission", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0016508520304480_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground & Aims\nInfection with SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which has been characterized by fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as shedding of virus RNA into feces.

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France.\nMethods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France.\nResults: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.\nDiscussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Psiquiatri\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Chevance2020-Assurer_les_soins_aux_patients_souffrant_de_troubles_psychiques_en_France_pendant_l_\u00e9pid\u00e9mie_\u00e0_SARS-CoV-2"}, {"title": "Cuidado respiratorio en COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0122726220300318", "doi": "10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001", "date": "2020-04-06", "authors": "Chica-Meza, Carmen|Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez, Luis Alexander|Villamar\u00edn-Guerrero, H\u00e9ctor Fabio|Moreno-Collazos, Jorge Enrique|Rodr\u00edguez-Corredor, Lizeth Catherine|Lozano, Wilson Mauricio|Vargas-Ordo\u00f1ez, M\u00f3nica Patricia", "medium": "Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Nuevo coronavirus 2019|2019-nCoV|Enfermedad respiratoria|Ventilaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica|Oxigenoterapia|2019 novel coronavirus|2019-nCoV|Respiratory disease|Mechanical ventilation|Oxygen therapy", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0122726220300318_meta.json", "abstract": "Resumen\nAntecedentes\nEl COVID-19 forma parte de la familia de los virus conocida como Coronaviridae.

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure.

Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.

Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects.

The infections, first limited in Northern Italy, have eventually spread to all other regions. When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R\n0, i.e. the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. Previous work has been limited to the assessment of R\n0 analyzing data from the Wuhan region or Mainland China. In the present study the R\n0 value for SARS-CoV-2 was assessed analyzing data derived from the early phase of the outbreak in Italy. In particular, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in 9 cities (those with the largest number of infections) fitting the well-established SIR-model to available data in the interval between February 25\u2013March 12, 2020.

Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated.\nResults\nMost patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P\n<0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P\n<0.05).\nConclusions\nClinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures.\nPregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2.\nHere we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Obstetricia"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Dashraath2020-Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Pandemic_and_Pregnancy"}, {"title": "A strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053620300161", "doi": "10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Daszak, Peter|Olival, Kevin J.|Li, Hongying", "medium": "Biosafety and Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Disease emergence|Surveillance|Risk reduction|Market biosecurity|2019-nCoV", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2590053620300161_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nA novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world.

Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis.\nResults\n112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram.\nConclusions\nThe clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Cardiolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Deng2020-Suspected_myocardial_injury_in_patients_with_COVID-19-Evidence_from_front-line_clinical_observation_in_Wuhan_Ch"}, {"title": "Rapid surveillance of COVID-19 in the United States using a prospective space-time scan statistic: Detecting and evaluating emerging clusters", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622820303039", "doi": "10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102202", "date": "2020-05-31", "authors": "Desjardins, M.R.|Hohl, A.|Delmelle, E.M.", "medium": "Applied Geography", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|SaTScan|Space-time clusters|Pandemic|Disease surveillance", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0143622820303039_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1.

The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language.\nStudy eligibility criteria\nInclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19.\nStudy appraisal and synthesis methods\nWe used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission.\nResults\n19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission.\nConclusion\nIn mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population.

Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects.

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.

Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia.\nMethods\nFor this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs.\nResults\nAmong 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25\u201343), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain.

The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate.

Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111\u2013158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Cloroquina & Hidroxicloroquina"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Fantini2020-Structural_and_molecular_modelling_studies_reveal_a_new_mechanism_of_action_of_chloroquine_and_hydroxychloro"}, {"title": "Viroporins and inflammasomes: A key to understand virus-induced inflammation", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272520300558", "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738", "date": "2020-05-31", "authors": "Farag, N.S.|Breitinger, U.|Breitinger, H.G.|El Azizi, M.A.", "medium": "The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Viroporins|Inflammasomes|NLRP3|Inflammation|Virus-immunity", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1357272520300558_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nViroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1\u03b2 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1\u03b2 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1\u03b2, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K+, H+ and Ca2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

White blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes were counted and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry.\nResults\nThe number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets were reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nConclusion\nAlthough, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals.

We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model \u2013 the \u201dRippled Newsvendor\u201d \u2013 with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and \u201dwear-and-tear\u201d (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk.

As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Giannis2020-Coagulation_disorders_in_coronavirus_infected_patients-COVID-19_SARS-CoV-1_MERS-CoV_and_lessons_from_the_pas"}, {"title": "Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620304116", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6", "date": "2020-03-20", "authors": "Gilbert, Marius|Pullano, Giulia|Pinotti, Francesco|Valdano, Eugenio|Poletto, Chiara|Bo\u00eblle, Pierre-Yves|D'Ortenzio, Eric|Yazdanpanah, Yazdan|Eholie, Serge Paul|Altmann, Mathias|Gutierrez, Bernardo|Kraemer, Moritz U G|Colizza, Vittoria", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32087820", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079867190", "filename": "S0140673620304116_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.\nFindings\nCountries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.\nInterpretation\nMany countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.\nFunding\nEU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020, Agence Nationale de la Recherche.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos", "Experiencias, Percepciones, Consecuencias"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Gilbert2020-Preparedness_and_vulnerability_of_African_countries_against_importations_of_COVID-19-a_modelling_study"}, {"title": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the use of MS disease-modifying therapies", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820301498", "doi": "10.1016/j.msard.2020.102073", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Giovannoni, Gavin|Hawkes, Chris|Lechner-Scott, Jeannette|Levy, Michael|Waubant, Emmanuelle|Gold, Julian", "medium": "Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082765294", "filename": "S2211034820301498_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neurolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Giovannoni2020-The_COVID-19_pandemic_and_the_use_of_MS_disease-modifying_therapies"}, {"title": "Being a Doctor Will Never Be the Same After the COVID-19 Pandemic", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320302163", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.03.003", "date": "2020-03-30", "authors": "Giulio, Mari|Maggioni, Dario|Montroni, Isacco|Ugolini, Giampaolo|Capelli, Patrizio|Ceppi, Lorenzo|Bonfanti, Paolo|Mariani, Andrea|Achilli, Felice", "medium": "The American Journal of Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0002934320302163_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Giulio2020-Being_a_Doctor_Will_Never_Be_the_Same_After_the_COVID-19_Pandemic"}, {"title": "Operational Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 spread in Radiology: Experience from a Singapore Radiology Department after SARS", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020303069?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.027", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": "Goh, Yonggeng|Chua, Wynne|Lee, Joseph K.T.|Leng Ang, Bertrand Wei|Liang, Chong Ri|Tan, Choon Ann|Wen Choong, Denise Ai|Hoon, Hui Xiang|Leong Ong, Michael Kah|Quek, Swee Tian", "medium": "Journal of the American College of Radiology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Operational Strategies|Radiology", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1546144020303069_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nAs COVID-19 infection spreads globally, the demand for chest imaging will inevitably rise with an accompanying increase in risk of disease transmission to frontline radiology staff.

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID\u00a0=\u00a08%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a050%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID\u00a0=\u00a09%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a044%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID\u00a0=\u00a06%, N PID\u00a0=\u00a048%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID\u00a0=\u00a06%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "G\u00f3mez2020-Recomendaciones_de_consenso_respecto_al_soporte_respiratorio_no_invasivo_en_el_paciente_adulto_con_insuficienc"}, {"title": "Do not violate the International Health Regulations during the COVID-19 outbreak", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620303731", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30373-1", "date": "2020-03-06", "authors": "Habibi, Roojin|Burci, Gian Luca|de Campos, Thana C|Chirwa, Danwood|Cin\u00e0, Margherita|Dagron, St\u00e9phanie|Eccleston-Turner, Mark|Forman, Lisa|Gostin, Lawrence O|Meier, Benjamin Mason|Negri, Stefania|Ooms, Gorik|Sekalala, Sharifah|Taylor, Allyn|Yamin, Alicia Ely|Hoffman, Steven J", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32061311", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079870863", "filename": "S0140673620303731_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Habibi2020-Do_not_violate_the_International_Health_Regulations_during_the_COVID-19_outbreak"}, {"title": "COVID-19 in children: More than meets the eye", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301174?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101649", "date": "2020-03-28", "authors": "Hagmann, Stefan H.F.", "medium": "Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV-2|COVID-19|Children|Morbidity", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1477893920301174_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Pediatr\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Hagmann2020-COVID-19_in_children-More_than_meets_the_eye"}, {"title": "Physiotherapists during COVID-19: usual business, in unusual times", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1836955320300291", "doi": "10.1016/j.jphys.2020.03.012", "date": "2020-04-02", "authors": "Haines, Kimberley J|Berney, Sue", "medium": "Journal of Physiotherapy", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1836955320300291_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Fisioterapia"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Haines2020-Physiotherapists_during_COVID-19-usual_business_in_unusual_times"}, {"title": "Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a pandemic (epidemiology, pathogenesis and potential therapeutics)", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300317", "doi": "10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100679", "date": "2020-05-31", "authors": "Hamid, Saima|Mir, Mohammad Yaseen|Rohela, Gulab Khan", "medium": "New Microbes and New Infections", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Pathogenesis|Phylogenetic analysis|Therapeutic strategies|Transmission", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083250487", "filename": "S2052297520300317_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R\n0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.\nFindings\nSimulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R\n0 of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R\n0 was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R\n0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R\n0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R\n0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R\n0 was 1\u00b75. For R\n0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Hellewell2020-Feasibility_of_controlling_COVID-19_outbreaks_by_isolation_of_cases_and_contacts"}, {"title": "The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from a one health perspective", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771420300185?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100127", "date": "2020-03-16", "authors": "Hemida, Maged Gomaa|Ba Abduallah, Mohammed M.", "medium": "One Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV|SARS-CoV-2|CoVID-19|MERS-CoV|Coronavirus|Outbreak|One health|Bats|Animal|Reservoir", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2352771420300185_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China that is now reported in people on inhabited continents.

"Abstract\nIntroduction\nThe World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold. As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese\u2013Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline.\nMethods\nThe national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world.\nResults\nWe presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients\u2019 disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases.\nConclusion\nTo control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Ho2020-Highlights_of_traditional_Chinese_medicine_frontline_expert_advice_in_the_China_national_guideline_for_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Preventing intra-hospital infection and transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare workers", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209379112030161X?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.shaw.2020.03.001", "date": "2020-03-24", "authors": "Hoe GAN, Wee|Wah LIM, John|KOH, David", "medium": "Safety and Health at Work", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus disease 2019|SEIPS|occupational health", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S209379112030161X_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.

Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital.\nMethods\nTwo patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections.\nResults\nThrough contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season.

The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated.\nResults\nThe lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other \ufb01ndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calci\ufb01cation or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45%).

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49\u00b70 years (IQR 41\u00b70\u201358\u00b70). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8\u00b70 days [IQR 5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1.\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.\nResults\nSequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain \u03b2 (SBD\u03b2). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD\u03b2 of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.\nConclusions\nWe reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans.

Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures.

This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus.

Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Oftalmolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Jones2020-The_COVID-19_pandemic-Important_considerations_for_contact_lens_practitioners"}, {"title": "Understanding COVID-19: what does viral RNA load really mean?", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302371", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30237-1", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": "Joynt, Gavin M|Wu, William KK", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302371_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Virologi\u0301a, Biologi\u0301a Molecular"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Joynt2020-Understanding_COVID-19-what_does_viral_RNA_load_really_mean"}, {"title": "Recommended prophylactic and management strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in transplant recipients", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300165", "doi": "10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.02.003", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": "Ju, Chun-Rong|Lian, Qiao-Yan|Zhang, Jian-Heng|Qiu, Tao|Cai, Zhi-Tao|Jiang, Wen-Yang|Zhang, Jing|Cheng, Qin|Chen, Gang|Li, Ning|Wang, Chun-Yan|He, Jian-Xing", "medium": "Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|Corona virus disease 2019|Transplantation|Pneumonia|Recipients", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2095882X20300165_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nSince December 2019, increasing attention has been paid to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Wuhan, China.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.\nMethods\nWe used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions).\nFindings\nOf 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5).\nInterpretation\nCountries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19.

To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions.

Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.\nMethods\nWe adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R\n0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R\n0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00b77%, 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.\nFindings\nFor the baseline scenario, when R\n0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000), corresponding to 7\u00b74% (IQR 6\u00b75\u20138\u00b75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727\u2008000 cases (670\u2008000\u2013776\u2008000) when R\n0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u00b73% (17\u00b78\u201320\u00b76) of the Singaporean population, and 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) when R\n0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u00b79\u201333\u00b71) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when R\n0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77) when R\n0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u00b72% (59\u00b70 \u221294\u00b74) when R\n0 was 2\u00b75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00b70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R\n0 of 1\u00b75.\nInterpretation\nImplementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.\nFunding\nSingapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Koo2020-Interventions_to_mitigate_early_spread_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_Singapore-a_modelling_study"}, {"title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak: What the Department of Radiology Should Know", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020301502", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacr.2020.02.008", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Kooraki, Soheil|Hosseiny, Melina|Myers, Lee|Gholamrezanezhad, Ali", "medium": "Journal of the American College of Radiology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|COVID-19|pneumonia|infection control|safety", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32092296", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082304917", "filename": "S1546144020301502_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R\nt) in Wuhan declined from 2\u00b735 (95% CI 1\u00b715\u20134\u00b777) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1\u00b705 (0\u00b741\u20132\u00b739) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R\nt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Kucharski2020-Early_dynamics_of_transmission_and_control_of_COVID-19-a_mathematical_modelling_study"}, {"title": "Invisible spread of SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 Authors' reply", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302759", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30275-9", "date": "2020-04-08", "authors": "Kucharski, Adam J|Eggo, Rosalind M", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302759_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Kucharski2020-Invisible_spread_of_SARS-CoV-2_Authors_reply"}, {"title": "Identification, synthesis and evaluation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089616303364", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2016.05.013", "date": "2016-07-01", "authors": "Kumar, Vathan|Tan, Kian-Pin|Wang, Ying-Ming|Lin, Sheng-Wei|Liang, Po-Huang", "medium": "Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "MERS-CoV|SARS-Cov|3CLpro                  |Coronavirus|Pyrazolone", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "27240464", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-84969980357", "filename": "S0968089616303364_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) led to a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia in late 2002.

On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24\u20133.58.

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters.\nMethods\nWe have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed.\nResults\nWhile COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nConclusions\nOur data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them.

This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases.\nMethods\nand findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases.\nResults\nOur data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2=0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2=0.98, p<0.01).\nConclusions\nThe number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis.

In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "LeTurnier2020-Multi-sectorial_research_is_paramount_for_preventing_and_controlling_emerging_infectious_diseases"}, {"title": "A case of COVID-19 and pneumonia returning from Macau in Taiwan: Clinical course and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG dynamic", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300608", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.003", "date": "2020-03-10", "authors": "Lee, Nan-Yao|Li, Chia-Wen|Tsai, Huey-Pin|Chen, Po-Lin|Syue, Ling-Shan|Li, Ming-Chi|Tsai, Chin-Shiang|Lo, Ching-Lung|Hsueh, Po-Ren|Ko, Wen-Chien", "medium": "Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Novel coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Pneumonia|COVID-19|Macau|Taiwan|Serology|IgG", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081687386", "filename": "S1684118220300608_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nA 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2-day fever and cough at seven days after returning from Macau.

The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality.\nResults\nA total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5\u00a0days, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).\nConclusions and Implications\nCombining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship.

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43\u201363), and 20 (58\u00b78%) patients were women.

Common symptoms included fever (31 [91\u00b72%]), fatigue (25 [73\u00b75%]) and dry cough (18 [52\u00b79%]). 15 (44\u00b71%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20\u00b75%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury.\nInterpretation\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44\u00b71%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20\u00b75%.\nFunding\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Cirugi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Lei2020-Clinical_characteristics_and_outcomes_of_patients_undergoing_surgeries_during_the_incubation_period_of_COVID-19_"}, {"title": "Comprehensive analysis for diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301420?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.016", "date": "2020-03-19", "authors": "Lei, Pinggui|Fan, Bing|Mao, Jujiang|Wang, Pingxian", "medium": "Journal of Infection", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0163445320301420_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Diagn\u00f3stico"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Lei2020-Comprehensive_analysis_for_diagnosis_of_novel_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_infection"}, {"title": "Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302000", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30200-0", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": "Lescure, Francois-Xavier|Bouadma, Lila|Nguyen, Duc|Parisey, Marion|Wicky, Paul-Henri|Behillil, Sylvie|Gaymard, Alexandre|Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude|Donati, Flora|Le Hingrat, Quentin|Enouf, Vincent|Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira|Valette, Martine|Mailles, Alexandra|Lucet, Jean-Christophe|Mentre, France|Duval, Xavier|Descamps, Diane|Malvy, Denis|Timsit, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|Lina, Bruno|van-der-Werf, Sylvie|Yazdanpanah, Yazdan", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302000_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nOn Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.\nMethods\nIn this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.\nFindings\nThe patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00b72 and 7\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\nFunding\nREACTing (Research & Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Lescure2020-Clinical_and_virological_data_of_the_first_cases_of_COVID-19_in_Europe-a_case_series"}, {"title": "Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750020300558", "doi": "10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30055-8", "date": "2020-02-20", "authors": "Leung, Gabriel M|Leung, Kathy", "medium": "The Lancet Digital Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079856428", "filename": "S2589750020300558_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Leung2020-Crowdsourcing_data_to_mitigate_epidemics"}, {"title": "Mass masking in the COVID-19 epidemic: people need guidance", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305201", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30520-1", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": "Leung, Chi Chiu|Lam, Tai Hing|Cheng, Kar Keung", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32142626", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081645570", "filename": "S0140673620305201_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Leung2020-Mass_masking_in_the_COVID-19_epidemic-people_need_guidance"}, {"title": "Correspondence from Northern Italy about our experience with COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346820302529", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2020.03.028", "date": "2020-04-01", "authors": "Leva, Ernesto|Morandi, Anna|Sartori, Angelo|Macchini, Francesco|Berrettini, Alfredo|Manzoni, Gianantonio", "medium": "Journal of Pediatric Surgery", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32278542", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083222374", "filename": "S0022346820302529_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Leva2020-Correspondence_from_Northern_Italy_about_our_experience_with_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301900", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30190-0", "date": "2020-03-23", "authors": "Lewnard, Joseph A|Lo, Nathan C", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920301900_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Lewnard2020-Scientific_and_ethical_basis_for_social-distancing_interventions_against_COVID-19"}, {"title": "Effect of interferon alpha and cyclosporine treatment separately and in combination on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in a human in-vitro and ex-vivo culture model", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218300949", "doi": "10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.05.007", "date": "2018-07-31", "authors": "Li, H.S.|Kuok, Denise I.T.|Cheung, M.C.|Ng, Mandy M.T.|Ng, K.C.|Hui, Kenrie P.Y.|Peiris, J.S.Malik|Chan, Michael C.W.|Nicholls, John M.", "medium": "Antiviral Research", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)|Type I interferon|Cyclosporine|Ex vivo explants", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "29772254", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85047058929", "filename": "S0166354218300949_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years.

As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication.

The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses' motivation to participate in disaster events. By understanding these factors, the government and healthcare administrators can design disaster education plans and other strategies to improve Taiwanese nurses\u2019 motivation to engage in disaster

novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nAn electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19.\nResults\nNine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD \u221231\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L; 95% CI, from \u221235 to \u221229\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L).

In the four studies (n\u00a0=\u00a01427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8\u201314.6).\nConclusions\nLow platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Hematolog\u00eda", "Medicina Interna"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Sistem\u00e1ticas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Lippi2020-Thrombocytopenia_is_associated_with_severe_coronavirus_disease_2019_COVID-19_infections-A_meta-analysis"}, {"title": "Estimating case fatality rates of COVID-19", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302450", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30245-0", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Lipsitch, Marc", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302450_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Lipsitch2020-Estimating_case_fatality_rates_of_COVID-19"}, {"title": "T-cell immunity of SARS-CoV: Implications for vaccine development against MERS-CoV", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216304016", "doi": "10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.006", "date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Liu, William J.|Zhao, Min|Liu, Kefang|Xu, Kun|Wong, Gary|Tan, Wenjie|Gao, George F.", "medium": "Antiviral Research", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV|MERS-CoV|Vaccine|T-cell|Epitope|Cross-reactivity", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "27840203", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85005943436", "filename": "S0166354216304016_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nOver 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections.

We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported.\nMethods\nClinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared.\nFindings\nCompared with the non-pregnant adults group (n\u202f=\u202f14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n\u202f=\u202f16) and clinically-diagnosed (n\u202f=\u202f25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7007, P\u202f<\u202f0\u00b7001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7001, P\u202f<\u202f0\u00b7001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6\u20139 days after initial CT scans.\nInterpretation\nAtypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement.

We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 12 cities had average AH below 4\u00a0g/m3, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05\u00a0g/m3). Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study. Each 1\u00a0\u00b0C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively. For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014. In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14\u00a0days.

We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations.\nFindings\nWe focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen.\nInterpretation\nWith an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.\nFunding\nGeneral Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Key Project Grants of the National Science Foundation of China.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelizaci\u00f3n"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Liu2020-What_are_the_Underlying_Transmission_Patterns_of_COVID-19_Outbreak_An_Age-specific_Social_Contact_Characterizati"}, {"title": "Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19?

COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world. The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00b798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.

A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019 or \u20182019-nCoV\u2019 or \u2018COVID-19\u2019.\nResults\nPublished cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8\u201392 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease.\nConclusion\nThe new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \u201cimmune enhancement\u201d). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases.\nDevelopment\nNeurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement.\nConclusion\nAlthough neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms.

This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Meo2020-Biological_and_Epidemiological_Trends_in_the_Prevalence_and_Mortality_due_to_Outbreaks_of_Novel_Coronavirus_COVI"}, {"title": "COVID-19: The forgotten priorities of the pandemic", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512220302346", "doi": "10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.04.004", "date": "2020-06-30", "authors": "Mesa Vieira, Cristina|Franco, Oscar H.|G\u00f3mez Restrepo, Carlos|Abel, Thomas", "medium": "Maturitas", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|Wellbeing|Social distancing|Vulnerable populations|LMIC", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85083287925", "filename": "S0378512220302346_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe zoonotic virus now named SARS-CoV-2 first infected humans in China, and COVID-19 has rapidly become pandemic.

The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy.\nMethod\nWe searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS.\nResults\nInitial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy.\nConclusion\nDespite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Momattin2019-A_Systematic_Review_of_therapeutic_agents_for_the_treatment_of_the_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronav"}, {"title": "The emotional impact of COVID-19: From medical staff to common people", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120304116", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.032", "date": "2020-03-30", "authors": "Montemurro, Nicola", "medium": "Brain, Behavior, and Immunity", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "SARS-CoV|Coronavirus|COVID-19|Mental health|Neuroscience", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0889159120304116_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Montemurro2020-The_emotional_impact_of_COVID-19-From_medical_staff_to_common_people"}, {"title": "Recomendaciones pr\u00e1cticas para el manejo perioperatorio del paciente con sospecha o infecci\u00f3n grave por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034935620300530", "doi": "10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.003", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": "Montero Feijoo, A.|Maseda, E.|Adalia Bartolom\u00e9, R.|Aguilar, G.|Gonz\u00e1lez de Castro, R.|G\u00f3mez-Herreras, J.I.|Garc\u00eda Palenciano, C.|Pereira, J.|Ramasco Rueda, F.|Samso, E.|Su\u00e1rez de la Rica, A.|Tamayo Medel, G.|Varela Dur\u00e1n, M.", "medium": "Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Anestesiolog\u00eda y Reanimaci\u00f3n", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Infecci\u00f3n|Virus|Quir\u00f3fano|Recomendaci\u00f3n|Infection|Virus|Operating room|Recommendation", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081924823", "filename": "S0034935620300530_meta.json", "abstract": "Resumen\nEn diciembre del 2019, la Comisi\u00f3n Municipal de Salud y Sanidad de Wuhan (provincia de Hubei, China) inform\u00f3 de una serie de casos de neumon\u00eda de etiolog\u00eda desconocida.

COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3\u2032-terminus.

In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized \u201cshortage\u201d definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages.

Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress.\nWe hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression.\nWe suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of

now been declared a pandemic. To date, COVID-19 has affected over 944,181 people worldwide, resulting in over 47,312 reported deaths. Numerous preventative strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been employed to mitigate the spread of disease including careful infection control, the isolation of patients, and social distancing. Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate. As new findings emerge, there is an urgent need for up-to-date management guidelines. In response to this call, we review what is currently known regarding the management of COVID-19, and offer an evidence-based review of current practice.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Nicola2020-Evidence_Based_Management_Guideline_for_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_-_Review_article"}, {"title": "Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920302292", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30229-2", "date": "2020-04-01", "authors": "Niehus, Rene|De Salazar, Pablo M|Taylor, Aimee R|Lipsitch, Marc", "medium": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1473309920302292_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nThe incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMethods\nWe used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.\nFindings\nThe weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22\u201364) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b74) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22\u201367) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18\u201368) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0\u201342) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.\nInterpretation\nEstimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.\nFunding\nUS National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Fellowship Foundation Ramon Areces.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Niehus2020-Using_observational_data_to_quantify_bias_of_traveller-derived_COVID-19_prevalence_estimates_in_Wuhan_China"}, {"title": "Urban inequalities in the 21st century economy", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622820301910", "doi": "10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Nijman, Jan|Wei, Yehua Dennis", "medium": "Applied Geography", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Urban inequality|New economy|Spatial inequality|Spatiality|Scale", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0143622820301910_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the last decade or so, inequality studies have assumed renewed prominence across the social sciences. In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales.

According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines\u2019 and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Nikolaou2020-Identification_of_critical_airports_for_controlling_global_infectious_disease_outbreaks-Stress-tests_focusi"}, {"title": "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220301193", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Nishiura, Hiroshi|Linton, Natalie M.|Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|Outbreak|Illness onset|Generation time|Statistical model|Epidemiology|Viruses", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": "32145466", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081989464", "filename": "S1201971220301193_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective\nTo estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.\nMethods\nWe collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.\nResults\nAccounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).\nConclusions\nThe serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period.

The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control.

This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread.

Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT. In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.

Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\nMethods\nPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\nResults\nOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2032-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2032-part spanning 24,341\u201330,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2032-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\nConclusions\nThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood.\nAims\nTo provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS.\nSources\nThe most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics.\nContent\nCOVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0\u20132.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7\u20131.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation.\nImplications\nThere is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level.

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Obstetricia"], "Tipo": "Revisiones Narrativas", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Peyronnet2020-Infection_par_le_SARS-CoV-2_chez_les_femmes_enceintes-\u00e9tat_des_connaissances_et_proposition_de_prise_en_ch"}, {"title": "Are we ready for the new coronavirus?", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409", "doi": "10.1016/j.arbr.2020.02.003", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Pe\u00f1a-Otero, David|D\u00edaz-P\u00e9rez, David|de la Rosa-Carrillo, David|Bello-Dronda, Salvador", "medium": "Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00eda (English Edition)", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081903425", "filename": "S1579212920300409_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Pe\u00f1a-Otero2020-Are_we_ready_for_the_new_coronavirus"}, {"title": "\u00bfPreparados para el nuevo coronavirus?", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289620300697", "doi": "10.1016/j.arbres.2020.02.009", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": "Pe\u00f1a-Otero, David|D\u00edaz-P\u00e9rez, David|de-la-Rosa-Carrillo, David|Bello-Dronda, Salvador", "medium": "Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00eda", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85081909310", "filename": "S0300289620300697_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neumologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Pe\u00f1a-Otero2020-_Preparados_para_el_nuevo_coronavirus"}, {"title": "Genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820300915", "doi": "10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104260", "date": "2020-07-31", "authors": "Phan, Tung", "medium": "Infection, Genetics and Evolution", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Mutations|Genomic diversity", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079863367", "filename": "S1567134820300915_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nCOVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.\nMethods\nTo examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).\nFindings\nOur projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66\u201397) and 24% (13\u201390) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.\nInterpretation\nRestrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R\n0 and the duration of infectiousness.\nFunding\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institute for Health Research, Wellcome Trust, and Health Data Research UK.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Prem2020-The_effect_of_control_strategies_to_reduce_social_mixing_on_outcomes_of_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_Wuhan_China-a_"}, {"title": "COVID-19 and immunomodulator/immunosuppressant use in dermatology", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220304667", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.046", "date": "2020-05-31", "authors": "Price, Kyla N.|Frew, John W.|Hsiao, Jennifer L.|Shi, Vivian Y.", "medium": "Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0190962220304667_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Dermatolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Price2020-COVID-19_and_immunomodulator_immunosuppressant_use_in_dermatology"}, {"title": "Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305286", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30528-6", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": "Pung, Rachael|Chiew, Calvin J|Young, Barnaby E|Chin, Sarah|Chen, Mark I-C|Clapham, Hannah E|Cook, Alex R|Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian|Toh, Matthias P H S|Poh, Cuiqin|Low, Mabel|Lum, Joshua|Koh, Valerie T J|Mak, Tze M|Cui, Lin|Lin, Raymond V T P|Heng, Derrick|Leo, Yee-Sin|Lye, David C|Lee, Vernon J M|Kam, Kai-qian|Kalimuddin, Shirin|Tan, Seow Yen|Loh, Jiashen|Thoon, Koh Cheng|Vasoo, Shawn|Khong, Wei Xin|Suhaimi, Nur-Afidah|Chan, Sherlynn JH|Zhang, Emma|Oh, Olivia|Ty, Albert|Tow, Charlene|Chua, Yi Xian|Chaw, Wei Liang|Ng, Yixiang|Abdul-Rahman, Farid|Sahib, Shafiq|Zhao, Zheng|Tang, Cheryl|Low, Constance|Goh, Ee Hui|Lim, Georgina|Hou, Yan'an|Roshan, Imran|Tan, James|Foo, Kelly|Nandar, Khine|Kurupatham, Lalitha|Chan, Pei Pei|Raj, Pream|Lin, Yijun|Said, Zubaidah|Lee, Anne|See, Cherie|Markose, Jessey|Tan, Joanna|Chan, Guanhao|See, Wanhan|Peh, Xinyi|Cai, Vincent|Chen, Wen Kai|Li, Zongbin|Soo, Roy|Chow, Angela LP|Wei, Wycliffe|Farwin, Aysha|Ang, Li Wei", "medium": "The Lancet", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32192580", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85082423866", "filename": "S0140673620305286_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nThree clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.\nMethods\nWe gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world.

Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019\u2019s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of \u223c5 days (range, 2\u201314 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49\u201356 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54\u201373%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be \u223c1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.\nData on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks\u2019 gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.

A week later, a new coronavirus was isolated in these patients, initially designated as 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. This is a new virus that is much closer genetically to the coronavirus of bats than to human SARS. The new virus infects and replicates in the lung parenchyma pneumocytes and macrophages in which the ACE-2 cell receptor resides. He has now infected many more people than his predecessors (>85,000).

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30\u2008000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3\u20134 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Remuzzi2020-COVID-19_and_Italy-what_next"}, {"title": "EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS DURING THE 2019 CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN WUHAN, CHINA: A DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY REPORT", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249820314698?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.008", "date": "2020-03-25", "authors": "Ren, Zong-Li|Hu, Rui|Wang, Zhi-Wei|Zhang, Min|Ruan, Yong-Le|Wu, Zhi-Yong|Wu, Hong-Bing|Hu, Xiao-Ping|Hu, Zhi-Peng|Ren, Wei|Li, Luo-Cheng|Dai, Fei-Feng|Liu, Huan|Cai, Xin", "medium": "The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "heart transplantation|COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|angiotensin converting enzyme 2|immunosuppressive therapy", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1053249820314698_meta.json", "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND\nThe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear.

This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace.

Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5\u201392.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8\u201374.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9\u201380.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0\u201330.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7\u201351.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1\u20139.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2\u201321.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.\nWe use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.\nOur most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409\u20137496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128\u20131929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588\u201313,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.\nMean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th \u2013 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Roosa2020-Real-time_forecasts_of_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_China_from_February_5th_to_February_24th_2020"}, {"title": "Impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable children in temporary accommodation in the UK", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266720300803", "doi": "10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30080-3", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Rosenthal, Diana Margot|Ucci, Marcella|Heys, Michelle|Hayward, Andrew|Lakhanpaul, Monica", "medium": "The Lancet Public Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S2468266720300803_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": true}, "handle": "Rosenthal2020-Impacts_of_COVID-19_on_vulnerable_children_in_temporary_accommodation_in_the_UK"}, {"title": "Maximizing the Calm Before the Storm: Tiered Surgical Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1072751520302635?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019", "date": "2020-03-30", "authors": "Ross, Samuel Wade|Lauer, Cynthia W.|Miles, William S.|Green, John M.|Christmas, A Britton|May, Addison K.|Matthews, Brent D.", "medium": "Journal of the American College of Surgeons", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "coronavirus|COVID-19|disaster planning|surgery department|resource management|triage", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1072751520302635_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th.

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being defined as the worst pandemic disease of modern times. Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Interacciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Sanchis-Gomar2020-Angiotensin-Converting_Enzyme_2_and_Antihypertensives_Angiotensin_Receptor_Blockers_and_Angiotensin-Co"}, {"title": "Cardiac injury is associated with mortality and critically ill pneumonia in COVID-19: A meta-analysis", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720302801", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.052", "date": "2020-04-19", "authors": "Santoso, Anwar|Pranata, Raymond|Wibowo, Arief|Al-Farabi, Makhyan Jibril|Huang, Ian|Antariksa, Budhi", "medium": "The American Journal of Emergency Medicine", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Cardiac injury|Coronavirus|COVID-19|Troponin|Mortality", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0735675720302801_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMethods\nWe performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%\u2013~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF\u03baB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Antivirales"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Shannon2020-Remdesivir_and_SARS-CoV-2-structural_requirements_at_both_nsp12_RdRp_and_nsp14_Exonuclease_active-sites"}, {"title": "In-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957220301428", "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.005", "date": "2020-06-30", "authors": "Shao, Fei|Xu, Shuang|Ma, Xuedi|Xu, Zhouming|Lyu, Jiayou|Ng, Michael|Cui, Hao|Yu, Changxiao|Zhang, Qing|Sun, Peng|Tang, Ziren", "medium": "Resuscitation", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "In-hospital cardiac arrest|Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|COVID-19|ROSC|Survival", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0300957220301428_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective\nTo describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China.\nMethods\nThe outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style.

It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation.

Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.\nFindings\n81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11\u00b70).

observed. Currently, detailed pathologic examination of kidney damage in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been lacking. To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules.

The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.\nResults\nThe psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.\nConclusions\nDuring an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.\nMethods\nIn this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.\nFindings\nWe collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35\u201360). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0\u00b70009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5\u00b72%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Sun2020-Early_epidemiological_analysis_of_the_coronavirus_disease_2019_outbreak_based_on_crowdsourced_data-a_population-"}, {"title": "Custom-made 3D-printed face masks in case of pandemic crisis situations with a lack of commercially available FFP2/3 masks", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0901502720301235", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2020.03.015", "date": "2020-04-02", "authors": "Swennen, Gwen R.J.|Pottel, Lies|Haers, Piet E.", "medium": "International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Reusable face mask|Face scanning|3D printing|FFP2/3|COVID-19|Pandemic", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0901502720301235_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur. A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease.

With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised.

ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Generalidades Cli\u0301nicas"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Tetro2020-Is_COVID-19_receiving_ADE_from_other_coronaviruses"}, {"title": "Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: perspectives from the radiation oncology service in singapore", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016781402030164X?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.radonc.2020.03.030", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Tey, Jeremy|Ho, Shaun|Choo, Bok Ai|Ho, Francis|Yap, Swee Peng|Tuan, Jeffrey K.L.|Leong, Cheng Nang|Cheo, Timothy|Sommat, Kiattisa|Wang, Michael L.C.", "medium": "Radiotherapy and Oncology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Covid-19|SARS-CoV-2|Pandemic|Infection control|Guidelines", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S016781402030164X_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nIn December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO.

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00b72 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71\u20137\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \u22120\u00b715, 95% CI \u22120\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b711; R\n2=0\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074\u20130\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R\n2>0\u00b79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.

For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3-4 and/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections.

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17\u00b78 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16\u00b79\u201319\u00b72) and to hospital discharge to be 24\u00b77 days (22\u00b79\u201328\u00b71). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70\u2008117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3\u00b767% (95% CrI 3\u00b756\u20133\u00b780). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1\u00b738% (1\u00b723\u20131\u00b753), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0\u00b732% [0\u00b727\u20130\u00b738] in those aged <60 years vs 6\u00b74% [5\u00b77\u20137\u00b72] in those aged \u226560 years), up to 13\u00b74% (11\u00b72\u201315\u00b79) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1\u00b74% [0\u00b74\u20133\u00b75] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4\u00b75% [1\u00b78\u201311\u00b71] in those aged \u226560 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0\u00b766% (0\u00b739\u20131\u00b733), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18\u00b74% (11\u00b70\u20137\u00b76) in those aged 80 years or older.\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Modelos Cl\u00ednicos Predictivos"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Verity2020-Estimates_of_the_severity_of_coronavirus_disease_2019-a_model-based_analysis"}, {"title": "Everything old is new again: COVID-19 and public health", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596320302050", "doi": "10.1016/j.pedn.2020.03.014", "date": "2020-03-26", "authors": "Vessey, Judith A.|Betz, Cecily L.", "medium": "Journal of Pediatric Nursing", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0882596320302050_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Vessey2020-Everything_old_is_new_again-COVID-19_and_public_health"}, {"title": "Patients with advanced basal cell carcinomas in treatment with sonic hedgehog inhibitors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period: Management and adherence to treatment", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220304795?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.057", "date": "2020-03-31", "authors": "Villani, Alessia|Fabbrocini, Gabriella|Costa, Claudia|Scalvenzi, Massimiliano", "medium": "Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0190962220304795_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Dermatolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Villani2020-Patients_with_advanced_basal_cell_carcinomas_in_treatment_with_sonic_hedgehog_inhibitors_during_the_coronavi"}, {"title": "School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235246422030095X", "doi": "10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30095-X", "date": "2020-04-06", "authors": "Viner, Russell M|Russell, Simon J|Croker, Helen|Packer, Jessica|Ward, Joseph|Stansfield, Claire|Mytton, Oliver|Bonell, Chris|Booy, Robert", "medium": "The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S235246422030095X_meta.json", "abstract": "Summary\nIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results.

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6\u202fdays). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan.

With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively.

The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable.

It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.

There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail.

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.\nMethods\nWe performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.\nFindings\nRegardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589\u00b75, 49\u00b73, and 37\u00b75 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2\u00b72 million.\nInterpretation\nImplementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Prevenci\u00f3n y Control"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Equipo de Protecci\u00f3n Personal"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Wu2020-Facemask_shortage_and_the_novel_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_outbreak-Reflections_on_public_health_measures"}, {"title": "Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131282030072X", "doi": "10.1016/j.chom.2020.02.001", "date": "2020-03-11", "authors": "Wu, Aiping|Peng, Yousong|Huang, Baoying|Ding, Xiao|Wang, Xianyue|Niu, Peihua|Meng, Jing|Zhu, Zhaozhong|Zhang, Zheng|Wang, Jiangyuan|Sheng, Jie|Quan, Lijun|Xia, Zanxian|Tan, Wenjie|Cheng, Genhong|Jiang, Taijiao", "medium": "Cell Host & Microbe", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": "32035028", "scopus_id": "2-s2.0-85079051459", "filename": "S193131282030072X_meta.json", "abstract": "An in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\u201324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\u00b768 (95% CrI 2\u00b747\u20132\u00b786) and that 75\u2008815 individuals (95% CrI 37\u2008304\u2013130\u2008330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\u00b74 days (95% CrI 5\u00b78\u20137\u00b71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\u2013805), 113 (57\u2013193), 98 (49\u2013168), 111 (56\u2013191), and 80 (40\u2013139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u20132 weeks.\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Wu2020-Nowcasting_and_forecasting_the_potential_domestic_and_international_spread_of_the_2019-nCoV_outbreak_originating_"}, {"title": "Positive effects of COVID-19 control measures on influenza prevention", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302253?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.009", "date": "2020-04-10", "authors": "Wu, Di|Lu, Jianyun|Liu, Yanhui|Zhang, Zhoubin|Luo, Lei", "medium": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|Influenza|Control", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1201971220302253_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic threat to the whole world.

The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N\u2009=\u2009301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N\u2009=\u2009216). Infected patient \u226565 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p\u2009=\u20090.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30% of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs.\nConclusions\nThis large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients \u226565 years.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Diagn\u00f3stico"], "Subt\u00f3pico": ["Pruebas de Detecci\u00f3n"], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Xiao2020-Dynamic_profile_of_RT-PCR_findings_from_301_COVID-19_patients_in_Wuhan_China-a_descriptive_study"}, {"title": "Evidence for Gastrointestinal Infection of SARS-CoV-2", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508520302821", "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055", "date": "2020-03-03", "authors": "Xiao, Fei|Tang, Meiwen|Zheng, Xiaobin|Liu, Ye|Li, Xiaofeng|Shan, Hong", "medium": "Gastroenterology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "XXXX", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0016508520302821_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Gastroenterolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Xiao2020-Evidence_for_Gastrointestinal_Infection_of_SARS-CoV-2"}, {"title": "Association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infection in 122 cities from China", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720317149", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201", "date": "2020-07-01", "authors": "Xie, Jingui|Zhu, Yongjian", "medium": "Science of The Total Environment", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Temperature|Novel coronavirus pneumonia|COVID-19|China|Generalized additive model", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0048969720317149_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus.\nMethods\nDaily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail.\nResults\nThe exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3\u00a0\u00b0C and became flat above 3\u00a0\u00b0C. When mean temperature (lag0\u201314) was below 3\u00a0\u00b0C, each 1\u00a0\u00b0C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209\u20136.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3\u00a0\u00b0C.

The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.\nResults\nFifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1\u202f\u00b0C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein.

For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.\nConclusion\nCT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00b75%) patients.\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002\u20132003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Yang2020-The_deadly_coronaviruses-The_2003_SARS_pandemic_and_the_2020_novel_coronavirus_epidemic_in_China"}, {"title": "The diagnostic and predictive role of NLR, d-NLR and PLR in COVID-19 patients", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156757692030494X?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106504", "date": "2020-04-13", "authors": "Yang, Ai-Ping|Liu, Jianping|Tao, Wenqiang|Li, Hui-ming", "medium": "International Immunopharmacology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "COVID-19|neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio|platelet-to-LYM ratio|predictive|age", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S156757692030494X_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nAim\nTo accumulate evidence that indicates the key role played by virus-triggered inflammation in the 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan City and rapidly spread throughout China.\nMethods\nAge, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte(MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and C-reactive protein(CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared.

Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals.\nAlthough TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals.\nThese enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions.\nPatients and Methods\nRadiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches.\nResults\nRecommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown.\nPatients and methods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\nResults\n28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010).\nConclusions\nCancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.\nMethods\nWe collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R\nt) at the provincial level.\nFindings\nWe collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33\u201356), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00b76 days (0\u00b70\u20139\u00b70) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5\u00b72 days (1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00b71 days (1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1\u00b708 (95% CI 0\u00b774\u20131\u00b754) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1\u00b771 (1\u00b732\u20132\u00b717) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30.\nInterpretation\nOur estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.\nFunding\nNational Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and European Commission Horizon 2020.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Epidemiolog\u00eda"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Zhang2020-Evolving_epidemiology_and_transmission_dynamics_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_outside_Hubei_province_China-a_des"}, {"title": "Identification of Kidney Transplant Recipients with Coronavirus Disease 2019", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283820302050", "doi": "10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030", "date": "2020-04-02", "authors": "Zhang, Hui|Chen, Yan|Yuan, Quan|Xia, Qiu-Xiang|Zeng, Xian-Peng|Peng, Jing-Tao|Liu, Jing|Xiao, Xing-Yuan|Jiang, Guo-Song|Xiao, Han-Yu|Xie, Liang-Bo|Chen, Jing|Liu, Jia-Li|Xiao, Xiong|Su, Hua|Zhang, Chun|Zhang, Xiao-Ping|Yang, Hua|Li, Heng|Wang, Zhen-Di", "medium": "European Urology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Clinical feature|Coronavirus disease 2019|Kidney transplant recipient", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0302283820302050_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and lethal infectious disease, posing a threat to global health security.

Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et\u00a0al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity.\nRESULTS\nThe main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow.\nCONCLUSION\nThe chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neumologi\u0301a"], "Tipo": "Estudios Observacionales", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "Zhao2020-The_characteristics_and_clinical_value_of_chest_CT_images_of_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia"}, {"title": "Epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of 32 critical and 67 noncritical cases of COVID-19 in Chengdu", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301086", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104366", "date": "2020-06-30", "authors": "Zheng, Yongli|Xu, Hong|Yang, Ming|Zeng, Yilan|Chen, Hong|Liu, Ru|Li, Qingfeng|Zhang, Na|Wang, Dan", "medium": "Journal of Clinical Virology", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "Epidemiological characteristics|Clinical features|Critical illness|COVID-19|Chengdu", "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S1386653220301086_meta.json", "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nIn December 2019, Wuhan, China, experienced an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020.\nWe collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients.\nResults\nOf the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease.

No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19.\nMethod\nIn accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed.

Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703\u20131\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761\u201312\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764\u2013128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70\u201324\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences

During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay.\nSpecialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources.\nInpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum.\nIn order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively.

The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.", "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": [], "Tipo": null, "T\u00f3pico": ["Tratamiento"], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "ulQamar2020-Structural_basis_of_SARS-CoV-2_3CLpro_and_anti-COVID-19_drug_discovery_from_medicinal_plants"}, {"title": "Infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 asociada a diplop\u00eda y anticuerpos antirreceptor de acetilcolina", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300682?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.003", "date": "2020-04-18", "authors": "\u00c1lvarez, \u00c1ngel Ignacio P\u00e9rez|Cuervo, Carlos Su\u00e1rez|Men\u00e9ndez, Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez", "medium": "Neurolog\u00eda", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": null, "open_access_licence": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0213485320300682_meta.json", "abstract": null, "clasification": {"Especialidades Cli\u0301nicas": ["Neurolog\u00eda"], "Tipo": "Otros", "T\u00f3pico": [], "Subt\u00f3pico": [], "Excluido": false}, "handle": "\u00c1lvarez2020-Infecci\u00f3n_por_SARS-CoV-2_asociada_a_diplop\u00eda_y_anticuerpos_antirreceptor_de_acetilcolina"}, {"title": "Impacto de la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2 sobre la actividad y profesionales de un Servicio de Cirug\u00eda General y del Aparato Digestivo en un hospital terciario", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009739X20301068?v=s5", "doi": "10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.001", "date": "2020-04-07", "authors": "\u00c1lvarez Gallego, M|Gort\u00e1zar de las Casas, S|Pascual Miguel\u00e1\u00f1ez, I|Rubio-P\u00e9rez, I|Barrag\u00e1n Serrano, C|\u00c1lvarez Pe\u00f1a, E|D\u00edaz Dom\u00ednguez, J", "medium": "Cirug\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola", "source_type": "Journal", "keywords": "surgery|COVID-19|healthcare personnel|infectious diseases", "open_access_licence": null, "pubmed_id": null, "scopus_id": null, "filename": "S0009739X20301068_meta.json", "abstract": "Resumen\nIntroducci\u00f3n: La r\u00e1pida expansi\u00f3n de la infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 ha supuesto una radical reorganizaci\u00f3n de los recursos sanitarios y la exposici\u00f3n de profesionales al contagio.

Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change.\nPatients and methods: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020.\nResults:\u2009Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived.\u2009Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents).\u2009Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation.\nConclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.", "clasification": {"Especialidades
